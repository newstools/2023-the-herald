The Herald Business Reporter The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) weekly foreign currency auction allocations have improved to average US$17 million from as low as US$9 million during the last quarter of 2022. The increase largely reflects increased demand from manufacturing companies seeking capital for raw materials and machinery and equipment. At inception, the RBZ weekly foreign currency auction used to allot between US$35 to US$40 million. The auction was set up as a price discovery mechanism for the local currency as well as availing foreign currency to local companies needed for procurement of raw materials and retooling. According to this week’s auction report, a total US$17,56 million was allotted, with US$7,85 million allotted towards raw material bids. The increased allotments come as Zimbabwe received improved foreign currency inflows estimated at over US$10 billion last year. Diaspora remittances grew 15,9 percent in 2022 to US$1,65 billion after around US$290 million was received in the last two months of the year. This compares to 2021 remittances of US$1,43 billion.
