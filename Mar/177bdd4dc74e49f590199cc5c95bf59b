The Herald Walter Nyamukondiwa Kariba Bureau Scores of passengers escaped with minor injuries when a truck side swiped a CAG bus along the Kariba-Makuti road earlier today. Motorists driving out or approaching Kariba endured several hours of delays as the vehicles blocked the road near Kaburi.  <img class="size-medium wp-image-676948 aligncenter" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/03/Untitled-112-360x201.jpg" alt="" width="360" height="201" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/03/Untitled-112-360x200.jpg 360w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/03/Untitled-112.jpg 680w" sizes="(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px" />
