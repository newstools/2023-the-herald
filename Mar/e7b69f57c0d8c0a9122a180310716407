The Herald Takudzwa Chitsiga-Sports Reporter IN-FORM Zimbabwe professional golfer Kieran Vincent managed to make another cut in the Asian Tour after he finished the second round on four-under-par at the ongoing New Zealand Open Presented by SKY Sports at Millbrook Golf resort yesterday. The Zimbabwean golfer is proving to be a force to reckon with on the big stage, as he is following in his elder brother Scott’s footsteps. Vincent was taking part in his third tournament of the Tour since moving from the Canadian Tour where he started his professional golf adventure. Now ranked 39 on the order of merit the 28-year old will see his standings improve after managing to make another purse cheque. The New ZEALAND Open presented by SKY has a purse money of NZ$1,65 million. Former President’s Cup player Christopher Wood is the leader at 12-under after the two opening rounds and is closely followed by compatriot Shae Wools-Cobb who is a short behind. First-round leader Wood from Australia fired a 69 on the second round with Jaewoong Eom, a fresh graduate from this year’s Asian Tour Qualifying School, is in a share of fourth, three off top spot after returning a 66 with three other players, that includes Australian John Lyras, another player to make it through the school, who fired a brilliant 62. Thailand’s Gunn Charoenkul, who was in second place at the start of the day, came in with a 69 and is just four off the lead. Two courses are being used this week in an event that also has a Pro-Am component with Hend, the 2016 Asian Tour Order of Merit winner, on the Remarkables Course, unlike the two players ahead of him who played the Coronet Course. Vincent will next week travel to Thailand for the International Series at the Black Mountain Golf Club from Thursday to Sunday.
