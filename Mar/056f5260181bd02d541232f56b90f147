The Herald LONDON. — Emiliano Martinez says his next “challenge” is helping Aston Villa to end their 27-year trophy drought, having been a central figure in Argentina closing their own long wait for silverware. The 30-year-old described himself as a “winner” who only ever “gives his all”, as he said one of the proudest aspects of his success is that half of the kids in Argentina now want to be goalkeepers. Speaking on BT Sport podcast, Mike Calvin’s Football People, Martinez lamented that too many young players go into football for the wrong reasons as he wants to leave a legacy. “I want to achieve something that no one achieves, or it’s been hard to achieve,” the Villa keeper said. “And obviously, people were saying, after the Copa America after the World Cup, Emi is going to go and play in the Champions League and he’s going to leave. “And I’m thinking, yeah, that’s the easiest part. You know that that’s easy leaving now in January going to a club playing the Champions League and all that. “It seems everything is easy. Actually, it was a real challenge for me. Winning a World Cup for Argentina after 36 years. Yes. Beating the champions of America after 28 years in the Maracana. “Yeah, that was a challenge. Winning the Finalissima against the champions of Europe was a challenge. And now we need something for Aston Villa after 30 years? I don’t know how long it was. 40 years? “That’s a challenge. You know, that’s a challenge. And that’s something I’m made for — for challenges, for not always having the easy way out. And we’ve got one of the best managers for winning things in Europe. So I’m up for the challenge.” — The Independent
