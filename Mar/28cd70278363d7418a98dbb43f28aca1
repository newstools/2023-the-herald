The Herald Prosper Dembedza Herald Correspondent Two company directors who are accused of erecting an illegal billboard discouraging people from buying a piece of land in Borrowdale, were remanded to March 14 pending a determination on their Supreme Court appeal. Grant Russel and Mark Strathen, who are being charged with criminal nuisance, are challenging a High Court order to proceed to trial in their matter after they unsuccessfully sought the court to quash their charges. The duo had filed their application for exception at the lower court, saying the charges were defective and must be quashed, but Harare magistrate Mr Shane Kubonera dismissed their application. He said the charges raised triable issues. Aggrieved by the dismissal of their application, they approached the High Court for review, but the court again ordered them to proceed to trial and defend themselves. Russel and Strathen then challenged the decision of the High Court and appealed against the judgment at the Supreme Court, where the ruling is still pending. The trial of the matter had been delayed due to several court applications they raised. Prosecutor Mrs Shambadzeni Fungura had on several occasions challenged them to trial, but to no avail. The State alleges that on December 10, 2020 at around 2pm opposite Celebration Centre in Borrowdale, Harare, Russel and Strathen erected a billboard with damaging information on West Property company in a bid to tarnish its image. It was alleged that Russell and Strathen caused false alarm to the public through the information written on the billboard. The State alleges that the billboard erected by the two had contents which were likely to interfere with ordinary comfort or convenience of West Propertyâ€™s clients. A report was then made to the police leading to the arrest of Russel and Strathen.
