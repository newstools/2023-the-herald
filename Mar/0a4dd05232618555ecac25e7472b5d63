The Herald Sports Reporter THE batting trio of Chamu Chibhabha, Gary Ballance and Johnathan Campbell scored fifties for Southerns Select but the Zimbabweans still found themselves on the receiving end after losing their first one-day match to touring county side Glamorgan by 59 runs at Harare Sports Club yesterday. The home team was set a challenging target after Glamorgan had piled up 321 runs before they were bowled out in the final over. The Southerns Select could only manage 262, all out, in 46.2 overs, in their chase. The county team decided to bat on winning the toss, and immediately Thomas Bevan and Sam Northeast gave them a fine start. They put on 62 in less than 13 overs, but then Ainsley Ndlovu came on to bowl and took three wickets, so that after 24 overs Glamorgan were 123 for four, with Bevan out for a fine 60 off 63 balls, and their innings could go either way. Glamorgan it was who took command, though, with a series of good partnerships and two fine fifties. Their captain Kiran Carlson led the revival with a knock of 59 off 58 balls, before Dan Douthwaite came in to play the most spectacular innings of the day. Douthwaite raced to 70 off 39 balls, an innings that contained no fewer than eight sixes and two fours. He was finally caught and bowled by Brandon Mavuta after 46 overs, at 293 for nine, whereupon the last pair took the score to 321 before the final wicket fell with one ball in hand. Ndlovu was the most successful bowler, with three wickets for 49 in his 10 overs. Blessing Muzarabani, returning after injury, opened the bowling, but bowled only five overs without a wicket for 24 runs. The other touring county side Durham claimed an easy seven-wicket victory over the Northern Select in the other one day game at Old Hararians. Results in summary:
