The Herald LONDON. — Thierry Henry believes Harry Kane should leave Tottenham this summer but Jamie Carragher believes there is only one “realistic’’ option for the England captain. Kane will go a 13th successive season at Spurs without a trophy after the club’s deflating Champions League football exit on Wednesday night. Antonio Conte’s side were beaten 1-0 by AC Milan over two legs to crash out of the Champions League at the last-16 stage. Tottenham’s exit looks set to spark fresh speculation over Kane’s future, with the 29-year-old linked with the likes of Manchester United and Manchester City in recent years. Arsenal legend Henry believes Kane should be looking for a new club and says the “outstanding’’ England striker is too good to finish his career without any trophies. “If I was him I would go,’’ Henry told CBS Sports. “It’s up for him to choose where but I would go, he has to know where he wants to go. “A player like that, a player of his calibre, should not talk about just his goals at the end of his career. If I was him, I wouldn’t be able to sleep at night if all I could talk about is my goals. “Listen, it’s a great achievement and I have massive respect for him — I think he’s outstanding. But if that’s the only thing you can bring to the table at the end of your career, that’s tough for me.’’ Kane has scored a record 268 goals in 423 appearances for Tottenham and is chasing Alan Shearer’s all-time English Premier League tally. As a result, former Liverpool defender Carragher believes Kane will be keen to stay in England if he does leave Tottenham but admits there are not a great deal of options for the striker. — Metro.
