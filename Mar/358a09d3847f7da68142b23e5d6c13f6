The Herald Chido Nyamuyaruka Court Correspondent A MAN has appeared in court on murder allegations after he shoved a person he owed US$6 on to a hard road, leading to his death. Gift Jamu (46) appeared before Harare provincial magistrate Mr Dennis Mangosi and was remanded in custody to March 16. He was advised to apply for bail at the High Court. The court heard that on Saturday at around 9pm opposite 346 Gora Street, Dzivarasekwa 3 in Harare, Moses Nkhulungo persistently demanded US$6 which Jamu owed him. Jamu then shoved Nkhulungo who fell on to the tarred road on his occiput, became unconscious, and started oozing blood from his mouth and nose. He was rushed to Parirenyatwa Group of Hospitals where he was pronounced dead on arrival. Blood stains were collected at the scene of crime by forensic examination experts and the samples allegedly matched blood stains collected on Jamuâ€™s jeans, linking him to the crime.
