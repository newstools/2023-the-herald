The Herald Takudzwa Chitsiga Sports Reporter LEADING Zimbabwe female rugby referee, Precious Pazani, continues to receive recognition at the global stage after it was confirmed that she will be among the referees who officiate at the Emirates World Rugby, Sevens Challenger Series 2023. Pazani is expected to be part of the match officials at the tournament that will take place in Stellenbosch, South Africa. The tournament will be held during the weekends between April 20-30. Pazani will be part of 12 match officials representing 10 nations that will take charge of the combined men’s and women’s events at Markotter Stadium. The highly-rated rugby official is not new to handling such calibre of rugby games as she was also involved in the 7s Challenger Series played in Chile in August last year. Pazani, who has officiated at several high profile matches like the Under-20 Six Nations, will have another opportunity to improve her curriculum vitae at another global event. World Rugby announced that, as part of their efforts to ensure that their match officials receive the highest level of preparedness ahead of all major upcoming tournaments, they will give as many qualified officials as possible an opportunity to officiate. Last year Pazani went through the mill at the centre when she teamed-up with South African Adriaan Jacobs and Aimee Barrett-Theron as assistant referees when France squared off with England at Stade Aime Gira in Perpignan. The Zimbabwe Rugby Union congratulated Pazani for her new appointment and encouraged her to lift the country’s flag high in South Africa. Pazani is one of the finest rugby referees in Zimbabwe and is constantly getting Rugby Africa appointments over the years.
