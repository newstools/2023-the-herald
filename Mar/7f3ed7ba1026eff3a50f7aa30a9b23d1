The Herald Takudzwa Chitsiga Sports Reporter HARARE City football club have been admitted to the Northern Region Soccer League where they will take the slot left vacant by the withdrawal of FC Prisons. The Sunshine Boys, who were relegated last season, were due to compete in the Southern Region as they had inherited the now defunct How Mine franchise when they returned to the Premiership after their initial demotion in 2018. A communiqué from Northern Region Soccer League chairman Martin Kweza yesterday confirmed Harare City as their new member for the 2023 season. “We write to advise that FC Prisons pulled out of the Northern Region Soccer League family owing to some restructuring exercise within their parent company. “Harare City FC has been duly accepted in the league, thereof. “Harare City FC will assume fixtures previously slated for FC Prisons. Revised fixtures will follow shortly. Kindly be advised accordingly,’’ wrote Kweza. The Sunshine Boys had been earmarked to play in the inaugural ZIFA National League that was expected to begin this season with 16 teams. But the kick-off looks unlikely following some reservations by the football stakeholders. The council-owned side was relegated from the Premier Soccer League last season after exactly 10 years in top-flight football. The Sunshine Boys were relegated together with fellow council side Bulawayo City and prisons sides Tenax and WhaWha. These four clubs were expected to be part of the inaugural ZIFA National League. It is envisaged that the new feeder league will provide slots to the top-flight league promotion. Harare City had been omitted from the ZIFA Northern Region Division One programme. They were not included in the fixtures programme that was released early this year.
