The Herald BARCELONA. — The Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) has provided European football governing body Uefa information about the investigation into alleged payments by Barcelona to a former refereeing official. “Uefa has requested information from the RFEF, the RFEF has replied and has provided all the information it has at the moment,” RFEF secretary general Andreu Camps told a news conference at the federation’s headquarters in Las Rozas. “Camps said the RFEF “have offered to take any other action that Uefa itself tells us to take.” Accompanied by the president of the Technical Committee of Referees (CTA), Luis Medina Cantalejo, Camps said the RFEF Integrity Department is studying the “Negreira case” after receiving the information they requested from Barcelona, the CTA and the RFEF. Camps said the RFEF has provided all the information requested by the Barcelona public prosecutor’s office, which is investigating alleged tax irregularities against a company owned by a former refereeing official concerning payments from Barcelona. El Mundo newspaper reported in February that Barcelona had paid around €6.5 million since 2001 to the company Dasnil 95 owned by Jose Maria Enriquez Negreira, a CTA vice-president between 1994 and 2018, to advise the club on refereeing matters. The affair has cast a shadow over the refereeing establishment that the current CTA chief wanted to clear up. — AFP.
