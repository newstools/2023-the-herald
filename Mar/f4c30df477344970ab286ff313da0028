The failure of Silicon Valley Bank — the second-largest collapse of an American lender in history — has spurred nervousness about potential spillover effects across the financial system and prompted US officials to move to protect depositors’ funds on Sunday. Bullion climbed to a one-month high and base metals pushed higher as the dollar and Treasury yields slumped on speculation the Fed will slow the pace of interest-rate hikes.

US data released late last week painted a mixed picture of the economy as the Federal Reserve mulls picking up the pace of interest-rate hikes. Inflation figures due Tuesday may also weigh in determining the central bank’s next move. Spot gold rose 0,9 percent to US$1 885,57 an ounce as of 11:06 a.m. in Singapore.
