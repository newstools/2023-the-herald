The Herald Nomxolisi Museta-Lifestyle Correspondent Before the introduction of mobile phones, a phone was exclusively a household device, a device used when needed by anyone in the home or office, much like a microwave. The launch and mass adoption of the smartphone has since established phones as a lifestyle product. The relationship that people today have with their phones and gadgets reflects much more our relationships with a close friend or better yet a spouse. As our relationship with technology has become more intimate, the need and demand for tech companies which offer fast and immediate solutions to our tech problems has grown rapidly. Zimbabwe has since opened up to these new and emerging technologies that are set to transform the country into a knowledge driven economy. It is important for Zimbabwe that these technological advances are not leaving the youth outs, creating opportunities for them to grow their businesses. While some of the youths are harnessing the new technologies to advance their aspirations in their lines of business, others have identified their niche market within the technology sector. In Harare, a group of youths is leading by example after they formed a technological company that has since become a one-stop centre, repairing cellphones and carrying out social responsibility programmes that are helping communities. Through technology, these young people are changing the community and their own status, as they reach new horizons through technology. Two friends, Munyaradzi Edson and Kudzanai Gore came together in 2020 to form iHelp Technology. “iHelp is an innovation and technological solutions company established to bring innovative technology solutions and technical consultancy services,” Tinotenda Zindoga, head of tech at iHelp said. Just as Steve Jobs of the famous Apple company started off in a garage, iHelp grew from humble beginnings. “Our main focus when we started back in 2020 was the repairing of apple products, hence the name”iHelp”. We started off small, with just a team of two individuals doing home calls during Covid-19 times, this was a huge foundation for us because very few companies were offering these services at the time,” he said. iHelp also operates as an enterprise consisting of five functional business units inclusive of the iHelp store, iHelp repair centre, iHelp business, iHelp hub and iHelp Foundation. The tech company has grown bigger and better following the lifting of Covid-19 lockdown regulations. Not only does it focus on individual clients, it has since branched out to big corporates like Cimas, Econet and BancABC. Natalie Saopa, the head of business development at iHelp also added that they had also moved from offering services for Apple products only as there was a demand in offering services to other brands. “We have had a challenge where most of our customers used to relate us with the Apple products only,” she said. <img class="size-medium wp-image-677563 aligncenter" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/03/Tech-firm2-360x201.jpg" alt="" width="360" height="201" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/03/Tech-firm2-360x200.jpg 360w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/03/Tech-firm2.jpg 680w" sizes="(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px" /> One of the founder iHelp members, Kudzanai Gore, (in white dust coat) chatting with clients at last edition of the ZITF Exhibition in Bulawayo. “We have shifted focus by including other different brands like Samsung, HP, Lenovo and many others. We also offer IT support and services for these same brands. “We have improved significantly since 2020, as we now have people sending their gadgets to our repair centre from all over the country including international clients from places like South Africa and the UK. This shows how convenient we are, because to us it doesn’t really matter where you are.” Apart from offering tech services to clients, iHelp is also passionate about giving back to the community. Edson Munyaradzi, the CEO of iHelp introduced the iHelp Foundation which partners with other members of the community in order to help the less privileged with food, clothes and school fees. “As a company we realised that we are who we are because of the community and there is no better way to give back than to serve the less privileged,” he said. “To top it up, iHelp is also introducing an educational platform called iHelp hub, a platform for young girls who are passionate about the information and technology sector. “A lot of underprivileged children are not afforded the opportunity to come across such platforms and what we are trying to do is to pave the way for these passionate individuals to acquire the necessary skill set.” “As it stands we are currently running a promotion in celebration of Women’s month where we are offering every female client of ours this month, a 10 percent discount for each purchase they make to show that we are not just about business.” Like any successful business would, iHelp also faces its fair share of challenges ranging from tunlicensed competitors to pricing. “What people don’t understand is that buying and repairing a quality gadget can be very costly,” said Zindoga. “Our country is yet to reach greater heights when it comes to technology and people still have a lot to learn. “In Zimbabwe, at least one in 10 people uses an advanced IOS device and explaining the costs to the growing numbers can be frustrating, especially since people are so used to purchasing cheap knock offs from the streets. “However, we are working on expanding by opening new branches around the country and adding services that will cater for everyone. Very soon we will be expanding our services to things like web designing, cyber security as well as gaming. It’s a work in progress.” Zindoga added that they have partnered a number of youth organisations as part of their mission to impact and empower knowledge on how to use technology effectively. “We have created a technology hub and partnered with The UnCommon group, Ignite Youth and Gogo Jabangwe Children’s Home among others.  We have hosted seminars in Zimbabwe and abroad,” said Zindoga One of their clients, Sharon Tapiwanashe Mapira said: “I bought a phone for my mother from these guys and I must say how convenient they were because I managed to get the accessories in one go. The team at the store was a very friendly bunch and I was not disappointed at all.” As technology continues to undergo transformation, tech companies in the country continue to grow with it.
