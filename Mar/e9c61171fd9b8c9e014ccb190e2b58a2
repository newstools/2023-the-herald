The Herald Crime Reporter More than 4 100 arrests have so far been made countrywide as police continue to intensify the enforcement of route permits and time tables for buses and other public service vehicles. Police are concerned with the unsafe conduct of some bus drivers who are not complying with timetables on route permits, resulting in such drivers being dragged into dangerous and reckless road races for passengers. Some of the operators were using fake route permits. National police spokesperson Assistant Commissioner Paul Nyathi said on Sunday alone, police arrested 483 people across the country in an operation on the enforcement of route permits and time-tables for public service vehicles, bringing the cumulative figure of arrests to 4 181. Last week, Asst Comm Nyathi said the enforcement of route compliance and time tables would be done in terms of the Road Motor Transportation Act. “The Zimbabwe Republic Police has noted with concern the conduct of some public service vehicle drivers who are not complying with timetables or route permits resulting in the drivers being dragged into dangerous and reckless road races for passengers,” he said. “This conduct has resulted in road traffic accidents in some instances. In a bid to ensure compliance with road traffic rules and regulations by public service vehicles, the Zimbabwe Republic Police will with immediate effect heighten enforcement on compliance with route permits and time tables. “Owners of public service vehicles are therefore advised to adhere to the dictates of their route permits and time tables forthwith. “We appeal to public service vehicle owners to cooperate with police officers to ensure sanity prevails on the roads.”
