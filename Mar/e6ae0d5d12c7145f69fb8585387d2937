The Herald ZIMBABWE Cricket (ZC) have announced the Northerns and Southerns squads that will face English county sides Durham and Glamorgan in a T20 series scheduled to start today in the capital. A total of six matches will be played between the teams over three days at Harare Sports Club. Southerns will take on Glamorgan in the first match of the series today, starting at 9:30am, before a 1:30pm clash pitting Northerns against Durham completes the day’s action. Tomorrow, Southerns will face Durham in the morning fixture, while Northerns will play Glamorgan in the afternoon. The last two T20 matches are pencilled in for Friday, with Southerns and Glamorgan clashing first before Northerns meet Durham again. The county teams, who are among the top first-class clubs within the England and Wales domestic cricket structure, are visiting Zimbabwe as part of their pre-season programmes.
