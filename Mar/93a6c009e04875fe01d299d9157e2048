The Herald Walter Nyamukondiwa Kariba Bureau At least 200 villagers in the Kazangarare area of Hurungwe District have received free oral healthcare, including tooth extractions in an ongoing outreach programme. An initiative of Forever Association of Zimbabwe (FAZ), the outreach programme has seen villagers in Wards 7, 8, 9 and 22 receiving the much-needed oral health attention. Some of the villagers had longstanding tooth problems of more than four years. Mrs Margaret Chavhuta who just had a tooth extracted at Kazangarare Clinic hailed FAZ outreach programme as promoting President Mnangagwa’s mantra of leaving no one and no place behind. “I have suffered for the past two years but dental services are not easily available,” she said. “We have to go to Karoi to have a tooth extraction because there are no dentists here.” A villager in the area needs at least US$20 to get dental services including tooth extraction. Another villager Mr Johannes Kairimbo thanked Government and its partners such as FAZ for bringing health services closer to the people. “We would like to thank President Mnangagwa for sending FAZ to help people in our area access medical services free of charge. I had a problem with my tooth for the past four years,” said Mr Kairimbo. FAZ Hurungwe coordinator Mr Mufaro Tota said FAZ had come up with the initiative to bring health services closer to the people. The outreach programme provided services to people in Kazangarare, Dete, Chikova and Chirundu among others. “The turnout has been more than we anticipated and I would say we are overwhelmed,” said Mr Tota. “We are referring some cases to Karoi and Chinhoyi but we realise that we need to expand the programme to includes other specialists such as opticians.”
