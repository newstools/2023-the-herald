The Herald A Chinese New Year Eve classic for families across China and around the world, the 40-year-old Spring Festival Evening Gala presented by China Media Group (CMG) kicked off on Saturday night with various high-tech twists. The Spring Festival Gala, also known as “Chunwan,” has been a must-watch event for Chinese New Year celebrations since its premier in 1983. Broadcast live in 8K Ultra HD and mixed with 3D Color Sound, the five-hour-long show featured singing, dancing, cross talks, short plays, acrobatics, Peking Opera and other kinds of performances to viewers worldwide. The show’s mascot “Tu Yuanyuan” has gained affection since the day it was released. It was the first original digital character designed from internet data analysis in the show’s 40 years of history. In order to integrate the mascot with performances, the production team deployed five AR cameras and motion capture technology based on 5G and AI analysis. The team also enhanced the rendering technology with stronger computer power for the mascot so the hair of the rabbit was bouncier and closer to reality. This year’s stage design was unique for its inclusion of an interactive art installation above the studio hall. Named “Man Ting Fang,” the piece adopted over 60,000 LED lightbulbs and was programmed with other mechanisms to showcase a flower blossom, which also embodies the name of the installation.
