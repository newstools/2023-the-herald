The Herald The World Bank slashed its global growth forecasts from projections it made in mid-2022 on the back of what it sees as broadly worsening economic conditions. The international development institution downgraded almost all of its forecasts for advanced economies in the world, cutting its growth outlook for the global economy to 1,7 percent for 2023, it said in its latest report, Global Economic Prospects. The organization earlier projected the world economy to expand by 3 percent in 2023. The adjustment was led by a significant downgrade to its prospects for the U.S. economy — it now forecasts 0,5 percent growth from an earlier projection of 2.4 percent. The World Bank cut its growth outlook for China for 2023 from 5,2 percent to 4,3 percent, Japan from 1,3 percent to 1 percent, and Europe and Central Asia from 1,5 percent to 0,1 percent. “Global growth has slowed to the extent that the global economy is perilously close to falling into recession,” the World Bank said, attributing an “unexpectedly rapid and synchronous” global monetary policy tightening behind the sluggish growth. The downgraded estimates would mark “the third weakest pace of growth in nearly three decades, overshadowed only by the global recessions caused by the pandemic and the global financial crisis.” Global growth has slowed to the extent that the global economy is perilously close to falling into recession. The World Bank said that tighter monetary policies from central banks around the world may have been necessary to tame inflation, but they have “contributed to a significant worsening of global financial conditions, which is exerting a substantial drag on activity. — CNBC
