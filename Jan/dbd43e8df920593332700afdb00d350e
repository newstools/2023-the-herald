South Africa-based international master Makoto returned home to win the tournament after beating Jemuse Zhemba into second position. Makoto said he is happy to have managed to win the tournament and is now looking forward to the World Cup. “I am very happy with this win. We had a small but competitive contest which had top players. I am going to work hard as we get closer to the World Cup. “I had so much competition from Zhemba who did well and I am looking forward to do well at the World Cup,” said Makoto. Spenser Masango was third while Emerald Mushore was fourth. The women’s section was won by Shaba, a gold medalist at the African Amateur Individual Chess Championships held in Kenya last November.
