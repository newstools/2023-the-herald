The Herald Yeukai Karengezeka Court Correspondent A Harare man who offered $45 000 in monthly maintenance for his five children was ordered by the magistrate to pay $100 000 and buy stationery and school uniforms twice a year when he appeared in the Harare Magistrates Court last Friday. Nelson Charamba was brought to court by his ex-wife Chiedza Murambizi who alleged that he was refusing to look after their children. “I can only afford to pay $45 000 a month because I do not earn much,” said Charamba. “I sell beer in Mbare and make about $35 000 profit a month.” Charamba said he did not understand why his ex-wife moved the children to an expensive school. Ms Murambizi objected to his submission, arguing that he earned a lot of money and also owned a bar. “Apart from the shop in Mbare, he owns a bar in Ushewekunze,” she said. “He wants to burden me with everything because I have a job.” “I had to transfer the children to a new school because they were all in special classes because of their poor performance. Right now they do not have enough uniforms and stationery.” The magistrate, Ms Ayanda Dhlamini, ordered Charamba to pay $100 000 monthly, and buy stationery and uniforms for the five children twice a year.
