The Herald MELBOURNE. — Novak Djokovic suffered an injury scare ahead of the Australian Open tennis tournament with a hamstring twinge forcing him to cut short a practice match with Daniil Medvedev.  The 21-time Grand Slam champion, who missed last year’s Australian Open after being deported due to his vaccination status, played just one set against Medvedev before withdrawing. Djokovic lasted a little under 40 minutes on Rod Laver Arena yesterday, in what marked his first appearance in Melbourne since being forced to leave the country last year.  The Serb, seeded No. 4 for this month’s major in Melbourne, initially tweaked his hamstring during his run to the Adelaide International 1 title last week. Speaking to 9News Melbourne after withdrawing from his match with Medvedev, Djokovic said “I just felt it pulling and I didn’t want to risk anything worse. “I played a set and apologised to him (Medvedev) and he was understanding. I just want to avoid any bigger scares before the Australian Open.” Djokovic broke Medvedev in the opening game but then received treatment while leading 3-2 and won only one more game from that point. Djokovic’s three-year visa ban was overturned in November, giving him the chance to push for a 10th Australian Open title when the major begins on January 16. The 35-year-old has won 34 successive matches in Australia, with his previous defeat coming to South Korea’s Hyeon Chung at the 2018 Australian Open. — Sky Sports.
