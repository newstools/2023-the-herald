The Herald Sports Reporter FORMER Mighty Warriors striker Rufaro Machingura has died. She passed on this morning at her house in Retreat, Waterfalls, Harare. She was 30. Machingura was the hero when Zimbabwe lifted their only ever COSAFA Championship title at Rufaro in 2011. Her five-goal haul in a match against Malawi powered the Mighty Warriors to the semi-finals. However, the talented forward fell prey to drug and substance abuse resulting in her being axed by Black Rhinos Queens three years ago. She is survived by a two-month old baby boy. <img class="size-medium wp-image-663837" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/01/WhatsApp-Image-2023-01-05-at-11.35.03-360x201.jpeg" alt="" width="360" height="201" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/01/WhatsApp-Image-2023-01-05-at-11.35.03-360x200.jpeg 360w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/01/WhatsApp-Image-2023-01-05-at-11.35.03.jpeg 680w" sizes="(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px" /> Rufaro Machingura Mourners are gathered at her house in Retreat.
