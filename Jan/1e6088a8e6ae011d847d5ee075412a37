The Herald Sifelani Tsiko Agric, Environment & Innovations Editor THE sudden death of Justin Muzerengi, popularly known as ‘Bistro,’ a man whose passion for cooking filled so many at his grill and restaurant spot – “KuHuku KwaJasi” in the eastern high density suburb of Tafara in Harare, has left a huge culinary gap for food lovers. Bistro, the chef known for his venerated KuHuku KwaJasi, collapsed and died on January 2 this year in the Graniteside industrial area where he had gone to do some procurements. He was 50. Bistro was a culinary genius who could take a simple dish and create culinary magic. He truly made the trip to Chicken Inn, KFC, Chicken Slice and other Harare fast food spots unnecessary. He brought a mix of indigenous and modern dishes close to the people in Tafara, Mabvuku and other surrounding environs, thanks to his food creative streak. His love for people, music, fashion and food turned KuHuku KwaJasi into a food lover’s paradise. Many people from across Zimbabwe and the Diaspora couldn’t resist the allure and charm of his great meals. With his creative cooking skills, Bistro’s spot became among the favourite places to go to in Harare’s ghettoes. Bistro started his career in the 90s, cooking at a small plate restaurant at Sunbird Tavern in Old Tafara. From Tafara Tavern, he later moved to Kamunhu shopping centre in Mabvuku where he built his brand further wooing food lovers from all over. After his joint at Kamunhu, he briefly returned to Sunbird Tavern before settling at Dombojena Tavern where he built his culinary brand further. People in Tafara, Mabvuku, Damofalls, Ruwa and the sprawling Caledonia area were quickly wowed by dishes like his grilled chicken, own made boerewors and chakalaka sausage, sadza nemazondo, sadza neguru and matumbu, gango, road-runner chicken, oxtail and other dishes served in a relaxed setting at Dombojena Tavern where he moved to years later. <img class="size-medium wp-image-668462" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/01/Untitled-47-1-360x201.jpg" alt="" width="360" height="201" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/01/Untitled-47-1-360x200.jpg 360w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/01/Untitled-47-1.jpg 680w" sizes="(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px" /> Some of Bistro’s culinary skills In the following years, KuHuku KwaJasi’s popularity only continued to grow. Bistro was very innovative and a culinary sui generis of his time. For years, people from various parts of Harare and many from the Diaspora consistently returned to the restaurant for the grilled chicken, sausage and a variety of indigenous dishes. Bistro was known for his culinary creativity and his humility. “He was a wonderful person first as well as a great chef,” says Joy Gadzikwa, a customer for years at KuHuku KwaJasi. “Jasi touched the lives of many through his cooking skills. He was married to his passion in life, which was his cooking. Even if you had a birthday party, a graduation event or other event, he pursued more fine dining endeavours whenever I hired him.” Bistro was humble and never craved the limelight as is the fashion in the hospitality industry these days. Make no mistake, however, his food at KuHuku KwaJasi was peerless in its creativity and execution. <img class="size-medium wp-image-668465" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/01/Untitled-48-360x201.jpg" alt="" width="360" height="201" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/01/Untitled-48-360x200.jpg 360w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/01/Untitled-48.jpg 680w" sizes="(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px" /> Bristo’s grilled chicken KuHuku KwaJasi was a bright light of Harare’s food scene in the ghettos. “He loved food. He loved music. And, whenever he was in the kitchen here at his restaurant, he showcased his beacon of creativity and commitment to delivering the perfect dish for his diverse clients,” says a top Harare banker, who frequented the spot on weekends. “We miss him. His food was music to my soul. A humble giant gone too soon.” Tributes have been pouring in from across the country and the Diaspora after the sudden death of acclaimed chef Bistro. “Death came and stole my role model, mentor, hero and a lovely father. He meant so much to me,” said Donell, Bistro’s eldest son. “Dad, your transition to the new abode left a void in us that no one can ever fill. After your sudden passing, we sadly say goodbye to an icon who brought joy to us as your children and entire family. I would have loved you to stay longer with us to see you enjoy the fruits of all your endeavours but the decision of God is supreme. “Dad, lived a life of generosity, kind heartedness, dignity and love. You were a selfless giver that loved pleasing people more than yourself. A bold and fearless man who stood for the defenseless and the needy. You always preferred to sacrifice your comfort, for the welfare of others.” Donell says his father’s death has left him with a heartache no one can heal. Says Bless It Up Motors bus operator and friend Absolom ‘Thomla’ Muyambiri: “I have no words to describe the loss. I don’t know where to start. To me l lost a brother and a reggae music mate. We shared so much in common. “It was our love of reggae music that cemented our friendship. Reggae music carries a lot of strong vibes and was a major force that uplifted our thoughts and minds as friends.” Charles Mungororo, Home Hardware owner and Bistro’s close friend says: “The cold hands of death suddenly snatched you away from us leaving us with torn hearts. I will forever miss the memories we shared at business and social meetings. “I bid you a bitter goodbye knowing very well that in our culture death is not the end. See you on the next side of life, Justin Bistro.” Many people in the UK, US, South Africa, Australia, Dubai, Botswana and other countries in the region also sent their condolences on social media. Bistro was known as a trailblazing genius at his food joint. “The death, just after New Year’s day, came as a total shock to us here in Tafara. We are trying to come to terms with the passing of a legend within our ghetto. Jasi was an inspirational figure to everyone who ever had the pleasure of meeting him or working with him and we are all devastated,” says Tracy Moyo, of New Tafara. Heartbroken friends, fans and food lovers have been sending messages of condolence paying tribute to the foodie genius of Bistro on social media. “He was an extraordinary talent and a beautiful human being. Jasi was full of personality and conversation. He was the sort of person you meet once and has a lasting impression on you,” Mazwi Seremani tweeted. He flew the gastronomic flag for the Tafara ghetto for a long time. Multitudes of ghetto youths and people from all walks of life paid their last respects to Bistro at his house in Tafara. After leaving his Tafara residence on January 4, his body was taken to Dombojena Tavern  – at KuHuku KwaJasi where crowds sang and chanted his name enroute to Chigandare village in the Goneso area of Hwedza district. Ghetto youths with motor bikes led the procession from his house as the hearse snaked through the neighbourhoods that he wooed people with his great food. He was given a massive send off. His fans climbed vehicles and lined streets, jostling for the best vantage point for the send –off parade. Bistro was buried on January 5 this year. Many at his rural home kwaGoneso were gutted to hear about his death. The ghetto culinary legend, whose KuHuku KwaJasi had become a powerhouse of the Harare food scene, was born at Mpilo Hospital in Bulawayo on April 07, 1972. He attended schools in Bulawayo, Hwedza and Marondera, where he did his O’levels. KuHuku KwaJasi became famous for Bistro’s mercurial genius, with his extraordinary African traditional and modern dishes. He was a pioneering restaurateur who saw the potential of Harare’s overlooked ghetto urban areas, opening his grill and restaurant spot. Bistro leaves behind his wife, Talent, two sons – Donell (24), Nyasha (17) and daughters – Kourtney (7) and Reign (2). He was hugely talented and infectiously enthusiastic about anything to do with food. Fambai zvakanaka Samaita!
