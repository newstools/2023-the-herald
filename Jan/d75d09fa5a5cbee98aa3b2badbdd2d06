The Herald Sports Reporter ZIMBABWE fast bowler Victor Nyauchi has been fined 15 percent of his match fee for breaching Level 1 of the ICC Code of Conduct during the second ODI against Ireland in Harare on Saturday. Nyauchi was found to have breached Article 2.9 of the ICC Code of Conduct for Players and Player Support Personnel, which relates to throwing a ball at or near a player in an inappropriate and/or dangerous manner during an international match. In addition to this, one demerit point has been added to Nyauchi’s disciplinary record, for whom it was the first offence in a 24-month period. The incident occurred in the 35th over of Ireland’s innings, when Nyauchi, after fielding the ball on his follow through, threw it in the direction of Harry Tector, hitting him, when the batter was within the popping crease and not intending to take a run. Nyauchi admitted the offence and accepted the sanction proposed by Andy Pycroft of the Emirates ICC Elite Panel of Match Referees, so there was no need for a formal hearing. On-field umpires Michael Gough and Forster Mutizwa, third umpire Christopher Phiri and fourth umpire Langton Rusere levelled the charge. Level 1 breaches carry a minimum penalty of an official reprimand, a maximum penalty of 50 per cent of a player’s match fee, and one or two demerit points.
