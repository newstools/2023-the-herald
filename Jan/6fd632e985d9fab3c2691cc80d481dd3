The Herald Trust Freddy Herald Correspondent A 49-year-old man from Honde Valley has been jailed 30 years for raping his 9-year-old niece. The man (name withheld to protect the victim’s identity) will, however, serve 24 years in jail after six years were conditionally suspended. He was convicted at Mutare Magistrates Court after full trial. In a statement the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) said they pushed for a stiff penalty in this matter to deter would-be offenders. The court heard that sometime in December 2021 the rapist followed the 9-year-old ECD pupil to a well that is 100metres away from their home in Gwenanguruve Village, Mutasa, Honde Valley. He then dragged the victim to a banana plantation close to the well and raped her once. The complainant tried to scream but the rapist covered her mouth with his hand. Further facts are that some time in September last year, the convicted also raped the complainant as she was in the field collecting sweet potatoes. The matter came to light when the complainant went to her mother’s place in Mbato Village, Mutasa, Honde Valley where she told her mother of the rape incidents. The complainant’s mother then made a report to the police leading to the arrest of the accused person.
