The Herald LONDON. — Kolo Toure has been sacked by Wigan — after failing to win any of his nine games in charge. The ex-Arsenal defender left his role as a coach at Leicester in November 2022 to take his first managerial job. Toure was only appointed Latics manager back in November on a three-and-a-half year deal, in his first managerial appointment. He was tasked with steering the club out of the relegation zone but instead things have only gotten worse with the side now bottom of the English Championship football and four points from safety.  Wigan claimed just two points from seven league games under Toure and were knocked out of the FA Cup after a third round replay against Luton Town. During his short tenure, the team scored just eight goals and conceded 21, even suffering three consecutive 4-1 defeats. A statement from Malachy Brannigan, chief executive of Wigan, on Thursday read: ‘’Firstly, I’d like to thank Kolo, along with Kevin (Betsy) and Ashvir (Johal), for their efforts during their time at the Football Club. ‘’Unfortunately, the results on the field have not been as we would have liked and as tough a decision as this was, the Board felt it necessary to give us the best possible chance of remaining a Championship club next season. ‘’We know that this time of year is a key period for any football club, ourselves included. Therefore, we will now work swiftly and effectively to ensure the right person is appointed as the next permanent manager of Wigan Athletic, with the immediate objective of remaining in the Second Tier for next season.’’ — The Sun.
