The Herald Sports Reporter NATIONAL Athletics Association of Zimbabwe will unveil new sponsorship on Tuesday afternoon. The association is expected to brief the media this afternoon at the Zimbabwe Olympic Committee offices. Athletics is the first sporting code to have an athlete who has already qualified for the 2024 Olympics. Marathon runner Isaac Mpofu posted a qualification in December after he ran 2 hours six minutes 48 seconds at the Valencia Marathon. Local runners are still bidding to qualify for the Summer Games. Although the standard times are a bit high the local association is optimistic that more runners will post the qualifying times. World Athletics have pegged the qualification times at 10 seconds for the 100m, 20.16s for the 200m, 45 seconds for the 400m and 1:44:70 for the 800m. Marathon qualifying time has been set at 2 hours 8 minutes 10 seconds.
