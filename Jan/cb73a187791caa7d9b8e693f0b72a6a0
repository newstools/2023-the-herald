The Herald Danai Chitakasha-Special Correspondent LOCAL football legend, the late Archieford “Chehuchi” Chimutanda was just something else. Apart from his great football talent which many feel he wasted because of his off-field shenanigans, he was known also for his unbridled tongue “kurasa muromo!” “Aitsvinya” (he was scornful), so to speak.  In Harare’s high-density suburb of Highfield, there used to be Machipisa Beerhall in the 70’s and 80’s before the neglect turned it into an eyesore. The beerhall (or what remains of it) is situated to the south end of Gwanzura Stadium (or again what remains of this good old stadium). So when the now-defunct Premiership side Black Aces were attacking the Machipisa beerhall end, Chimutanda would play a one-two with a teammate. The teammate would then attempt a shot at goal and the ball would end up  flying  past the goalposts, past the precast wall and land in the car park just outside the stadium (or again what remains of the car park). From what I heard, they said Chimutanda would then say: “Vafunga kutamba bhora nehama dzavo dziri mubhawa, manje vaakudzipasira bhora!!” (They have decided to play football with their relatives out there in the bar, and they are now passing the ball to them). Chimutanda… the flawed genius! What a character! Have a great day!
