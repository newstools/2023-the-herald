The Herald Senior Court Reporter TWO bouncers who allegedly assaulted and tried to stab security guards at Pabloz Nite Club in Borrowdale, Harare, on Christmas Eve, are expected back in court today for a ruling on their bail applications. Blessing Kumunda (36) and Gideon Sanyangore (32) initially appeared in court last week on attempted murder charges. Regional magistrate Mr Stanford Mambanje was supposed to deliver the bail ruling yesterday but failed as he was overwhelmed with work and set this afternoon for his decision. Mr George Manokore, appearing for the State, alleges that at around 2.30am on Christmas Eve, the two bouncers were drinking beer at Pabloz Nite Club in Borrowdale when they were approached by two private security guards assigned to Pabloz, Wilson Kaminyu and Munyaradzi Runganga, and were told to leave as the night club was closing. The two bouncers allegedly refused to leave the club, ending up picking a scuffle with the security guards. It is said that when theyÂ  got out of the joint, the two bouncers started assaulting the two private guards with fists. The court heard that at that time, Kumunda pulled out an Okapi knife and tried to stab Mr Runganga on his stomach, but missed him. Kumunda allegedly then turned on Mr Kaminyu and tried to stab him on his stomach, but he managed to block the knife with his left hand, at the cost of deep cuts across his four fingers. It is said that Kumunda and Sanyangore then disappeared. The court heard that the incident was captured on CCTV.
