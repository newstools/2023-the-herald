Speaking while receiving the ambulance at State House today, Prof Zvobgo applauded President Mnangagwa for being a man of his word. “I am really over excited. This is one of the clear indications of Second Republic’s connectivity and connections with the generality of the people. “This Government takes churches very seriously particularly African churches, as you know prior to independence African churches were looked down by the whites with suspicion but now we are exalted,” he said.
