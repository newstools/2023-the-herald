The Herald European nations on Wednesday recommended imposing new restrictions on travellers from China amid fears of an increase in Covid-19 cases. Passengers departing from China will likely have to present a negative Covid-19 test before leaving the country if heading toward one of the 27 EU countries. They will also likely be asked to wear facial masks during the flights and potentially be subjected to random testing on arrival. “The Member States agreed on a coordinated precautionary approach in the light of Covid-19 developments in China,” said a statement issued Wednesday, following a meeting of EU officials that lasted several hours. Health policy comes under the jurisdiction of individual governments. It is up to the various capitals to decide whether they will follow EU recommendations. Several EU nations have already stepped up their protection measures against potential new cases from China. Officials in China have criticized recently imposed testing requirements on travellers from the country and threatened to take reciprocal countermeasures. China currently requires foreign visitors to produce a negative Covid-19 test before entering the country, as well as to quarantine for eight days following their arrival. Beijing targets to scrap the confinement requirement this coming weekend, but will continue to demand proof of negative Covid-19 tests from visitors from abroad. In December, it also said it would restart issuing visas for residents to travel abroad. — CNBC.
