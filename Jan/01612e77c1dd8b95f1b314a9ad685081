The Herald Ivan Zhakata Herald Correspondent NINE Palestinians have reportedly been killed during the invasion of Jenin in the northern occupied West Bank in Palestine by Israeli forces. The Israeli forces allegedly prevented ambulances from reaching the wounded by shooting at medical personnel. The embassy of the State of Palestine in Harare has condemned the assassination committed by the Israeli apartheid occupation forces. Ambassador of Palestine to Zimbabwe Mr Tamer Almassri said the Israeli forces also fired tear gas bombs towards the paediatric section of Jenin Government Hospital causing suffocation cases from gas inhalation among Palestinians, including mothers and children. “The latest crime is a continuity of Israel’s ongoing aggression on the Palestinian people as well as an act of war that should not be tolerated,” he said.
