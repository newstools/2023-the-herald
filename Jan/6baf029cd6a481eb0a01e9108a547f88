The Herald NEW YORK. — American women’s tennis legend Martina Navratilova has been diagnosed with both throat and breast cancer. And Navratilova said she will “fight with all I have got” after being diagnosed with throat and breast cancers. The 66-year-old, one of the greatest tennis players of all time, previously underwent treatment for early-stage breast cancer in 2010 and had been cancer-free since. She announced on Monday the discovery of the new cancers — unrelated to each other. “This double whammy is serious but still fixable, and I’m hoping for a favourable outcome,” she said. “It’s going to stink for a while but I will fight with all I have got.” The 66-year-old later tweeted: “Needless to say my phone and Twitter are both blowing up so I will say again — thank you all for your support and I am not done yet.” Navratilova had been due to travel to Melbourne for the forthcoming Australian Open to work as a TV pundit. That trip has been cancelled, said her representative, who added that the former world No. 1 hoped to be able to contribute to the Tennis Channel’s coverage remotely. “Martina Navratilova has been diagnosed with stage one throat cancer,” read a statement. “The prognosis is good and Martina will start her treatment this month. “The cancer type is HPV and this particular type responds really well to treatment. Martina noticed an enlarged lymph node in her neck during the WTA finals in Fort Worth. When it didn’t go down, a biopsy was performed, the results came back as stage one throat cancer. — BBC Sport
