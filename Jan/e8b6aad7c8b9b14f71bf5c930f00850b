The Herald MOSCOW. — Chief of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces Valery Gerasimov has been appointed the new commander of Russia’s integrated group of forces in Ukraine, the Defence Ministry said yesterday. Gerasimov will succeed Sergei Surovikin, commander-in-chief of the Russian Aerospace Forces, who was appointed commander of Russia’s integrated group of forces in the special military operation in Ukraine in October last year. Surovikin, Commander-in-Chief of the Ground Forces Oleg Salyukov, and Deputy Chief of the General Staff Alexei Kim have been appointed as Gerasimov’s deputies, according to the ministry. The decision was made due to the fact that a wider range of tasks will be implemented within the scope of the special military operation, the ministry said, adding that closer interaction will be required between branches of the forces, and the troops will need stronger support as well as more effective command and control. — Xinhua
