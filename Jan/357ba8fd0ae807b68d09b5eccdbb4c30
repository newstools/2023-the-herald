The Herald LONDON. — Chelsea are already willing to listen to offers for Raheem Sterling despite the England start only joining last summer, it’s claimed. Sterling (28) joined the Blues from serial English Premier League football winners Manchester City for £50million. The Three Lions international penned a five-year deal at Stamford Bridge, which would keep him at the club until the summer of 2027. However, like his Chelsea team-mates, Sterling has been shy in front of goal. He has just four league goals to his name in 15 outings this term. And according to Football Insider, Chelsea are willing to let Sterling leave especially after snapping up Mykhailo Mudryk from under the nose of Arsenal. The 22-year-old wonderkid signed an eight-and-a-half-year deal following an £88m transfer from Shakhtar Donetsk. Mudryk was presented to the Stamford Bridge crowd on Sunday at half-time. Ukrainian Mudryk could get started before Sterling comes back from injury too, which could dent his chances of regaining a starting spot. Boss Graham Potter said on the January signing: “He’s exciting, one-versus-one, can threaten the goal. I think our supporters already like him. “I’m the head coach and as you know, I’ve had enough to worry about and what is right for the club. “If I’m here for the length of his contract, I’ll be happy.” — The Sun
