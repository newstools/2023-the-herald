Cde Masenda was suspended by the provincial executive committee (PEC) together with provincial secretary for administration, Cde Rudo Munyonga recently following several allegations of misconduct levelled against him. He was barred from calling, officiating and addressing any meetings and entering party offices. The upliftment of the suspension by the national security department will, however, see Cde Masenda continue conducting his duties until the outcome of the investigations.
