The Herald Takudzwa Chitsiga-Sports Reporter PREMIERSHIP football side Black Rhinos were handed a timely boost ahead of the upcoming season when they received two pairs of training kits from clothing line Style by Minie in Harare yesterday. The army side, who are training at the National Sports Stadium B Arena, are looking forward to continue with their fine form under head coach Stanford “Stix” Mutizwa and received the kits which are in their red and white home and away colours. Speaking at the handover ceremony, Cotleigh Mandizvidza, the Style by Minie representative, said the donation is part of their corporate social responsibility. “We are very happy to have donated these training kits to Black Rhinos, a Premiership side, as a way of motivating them ahead of the upcoming season. “We have decided to give back to the team as part of our corporate social responsibility and sports plays an important role as it is regarded as a profession. This is our first time to donate to a sports team and we are hopeful we will continue to work with more sporting disciplines. “We were focusing on artists in the past but we have since diverted to sports and I hope the relationship with Black Rhinos will continue,” said Mandizvidza. Black Rhinos organising secretary, Sympathy Buka, who presided over the hand-over ceremony, said they are happy with the kits they received and it will help motivate the team ahead of the new Premiership season. “We are very grateful for the kind gesture we received from Style by Minie who gave us two training kits for this season. The apparel helps us to be identified. We have been training with different apparels but with these kits, we are uniform and it gives the players identity and we are going to pay back the kind gesture by doing well in the league by winning matches. “The boys will be well dressed and it makes them feel comfortable during training,” said Buka.
