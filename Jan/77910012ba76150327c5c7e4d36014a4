The Herald Takudzwa Chitsiga Sports Reporter LOCAL amateur golfers will rekindle their rivalry this year when they clash in the Dugmore Trophy, which tees off at Bulawayo Golf Club in Bulawayo this morning. The Dugmore Trophy is a 72-hole event played in honour of the late golfing icon, Charlie Dugmore, and will run until tomorrow.  This annual event brings together almost all the top amateur golfers in Zimbabwe and this year’s event will be attended by visiting Royal and Ancient Africa manager, Eden Thompson. Last year the tournament was won by Michael Wallace who managed to beat a field of 56 players. The Borrowdale Brooke-based top amateur golfer managed to score rounds of 71, 78 and 70 for a total 219 to win the opening tournament of the Zimbabwe Golf Association calendar. Dugmore Trophy has both individual and team events and Wingate will only be represented by in-form Munashe Ndaruza.. Ndaruza won several events last year including the Julius Robinson Trophy on his home course at Wingate before going on to win the Chapman Grand Slam, the Masvingo Amateur Championship, the Roland Park Open and Bata Power. “I have been training hard and I think I will play well in the tournament. There is so much competition in the amateur ranks and I am happy that I managed to break into the national team last year. “Bulawayo Golf Club is a very good course and I hope we will not be disturbed by the weather,” said Ndaruza.
