The Herald Sports Reporter SWIMMING coach Phawulani Ngwenya is confident the ongoing Africa Aquatics (CANA) training camp in South Africa is going to make a difference for the swimmers taking part. Nine local swimmers accompanied by Ngwenya are part of the camp that attracted more than 80 participants from the continent. “There is a lot of benefits in the sense that in terms of their fitness levels we definitely think they would improve, and then be able to compete at high level, with high intensity at high speed because it’s about taking off time. It’s all about improving, scoring PBs (personal best times) every time you are in the water. “So this will also help them to get prepared because we have over 80 swimmers here and it’s a big crowd. So you also get to learn and share ideas and also compete at a higher level,” said Ngwenya. The swimmers are scheduled to participate in a competition set for Saturday as part of the training camp. “On Saturday we are having a competition and we think this kind of competition with top performers in Africa will definitely benefit the swimmers. “For me as a coach, already there are other six coaches here, some of them have participated in Olympics. They have swum at the high level. I have not been able to swim at a high level, some of them have been to World Junior Championships as coaches, I haven’t been able to do that. “So it’s really a massive exposure programme for me in terms of improving my coaching credentials, in terms of improving my mindset, networking and getting new ideas and new systems in swimming because it’s such a high evolving sport,” said Ngwenya. The nine swimmers taking part are Andile Mhlope, Mikayla Makwabarara, Nathan Ngwenya, Onesimus Ngwenya, Tafadzwa Chandiwana, Benjamin Rorke, Matida Musere, Tanatswa Chandiwana and Tawanda Chisungo.
