The Herald LONDON. — Antonio Conte will leave English Premiership football Tottenham Hotspur at the end of the season, according to reports. The Italian is only under contract with the Lilywhites until June. Spurs possess the option to trigger a 12 month extension in the deal. But according to Italian expert Gianluca DiMarzio, they will let Conte’s contract expire and he will depart. Appearing on Sky in Italy, DiMarzio lifted the lid on the 53-year-old’s situation. He said: “The news I can tell you with certainty is that Antonio Conte will leave Tottenham at the end of the season. “There was no spark, his contract is expiring and the club has not asked him for a renewal. “The club does not like the frequent jibes. “Conte wants players to win, while the club prefers to trade, the feeling with the club has not clicked. “His family, among other things, has remained in Italy.” The former Chelsea boss was appointed by Spurs in November 2021 as successor to Nuno Espirito Santo. He helped inspire an upturn in form that led to Tottenham pipping Arsenal to fourth spot last term. But things have gone backwards this time around, with Spurs’ performances largely poor even in victory. Tottenham have picked up just four points from four league games since the English Premier League resumed following the World Cup. They sit fifth in the table, six points off the top four. Conte has had to deal with a great deal of trauma this season. Long-term friend and Spurs fitness coach Gian Piero Ventrone passed away following a short illness in October. While Italian pal Gianluca Vialli died earlier this month. Mauricio Pochettino and Thomas Tuchel have both been linked with Spurs job in recent weeks. It’s been claimed that a reunion with ex-boss Poch would be a priority over Tuchel, who if appointed would be the fifth former Chelsea manager hired by Tottenham’s current ownership. — The Sun.
