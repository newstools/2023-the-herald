The Herald MANCHESTER. — Erik ten Hag has told Marcus Rashford that he wants to build his team around the forward to make Manchester United the best in the world.  The 25-year-old forward has scored nine goals in as many games since returning from the World Cup, but there is uncertainty over his future at Old Trafford. Rashford has entered the final 18 months of his £200 000-a-week contract after United triggered a one-year extension clause, and the club want to agree terms over a new deal amid strong interest from Paris Saint-Germain. Ten Hag has helped to revive Rashford’s career since taking over in the summer, and he reminded the homegrown player that the way United play has also brought the best out of him. Asked about Rashford’s contract situation on Tuesday, Ten Hag said: “I think he understands Man United is his club, that’s first. But also, in this environment, in this team, I think he is playing his best football. “Then, I would say this is the best place to be because we want to construct the best team, first in England, then in Europe, then in the world. “He is improving and that is about him because he is giving 100 per cent energy. I think also in this team he can bring his qualities. This team is constructed so that his qualities come to the fore and I think he knows that. But definitely he is important for us and if we want to get the success we want, we need him.’’ Rashford has scored 17 goals in all competitions for United this season and shone for England at the World Cup in Qatar. Asked about a potential revival of PSG’s interest in Rashford, Ten Hag said: “I hope that all our players get an interest from clubs because that means we do a good job, the team is outperforming, so that is what we are aiming for. — Mailonline.
