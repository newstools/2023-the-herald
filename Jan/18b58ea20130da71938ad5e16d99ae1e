The Herald BOURNEMOUTH. — Jordan Zemura insists dropping into the English Premiership football relegation zone for the first time this campaign is not a psychological blow to the AFC Bournemouth squad, adding: “By the end of the season, we’ll be in a very good place.” Zimbabwean defender Zemura was one of five men drafted into the starting XI to face Nottingham Forest on Saturday, as Cherries looked to halt a run of six straight defeats in all competitions. The 23-year-old impressed going forwards from left-back on his 14th top-flight appearance, winning the man-of-the-match award as the two sides shared a 1-1 draw. Despite picking up a point, Cherries slipped down to 18th in the table, with 17 points from their 20 matches.  Just three points separate 14th-placed Leicester City and rock-bottom Southampton. Asked if it is a blow mentally to know Cherries will be in the bottom three for two weeks before they return to the field at Brighton on February 4, Zemura told the Daily Echo: “No, nothing like that. I think from bottom of the table to where Forest are is five or six points difference. “That’s two games, two wins and then they could be where Forest are (in 13th). “I think for us, we know we’re there, we’re still fighting, we’re in and around it. “It’s January now, more players are coming back from injury and then Dango (Ouattara) was excellent, we’ve got players like that coming in. — The Daily Echo
