The Herald David Makora-Masters student at University of Zimbabwe The seasonal weather cycles have brought fundamental transformation in the manner in which people adapt to environmental changes. The summer season is characterised by heavy rainfall patterns and heatwave due to high temperatures and cloudy weather. It is also the longest season that stretches from October with the beginning of early rains to April with late rains being experienced. The divergent weather patterns presented by the summer season therefore require sensitive adaptations to cope with the daily weather demands. The youths find it blissful to express their different fashion styles at different occasions as demanded by daily weather patterns. During sunny weather with high temperatures and heatwave, the youths can be found wearing shorts, T-shirts, vest, muscle tops as part of their casual wear. In terms of formal wear during this hot weather setting,they usually embrace short sleeved shirts to suit the weather demands. Being the hottest season too, the youths find themselves in resort areas for leisure and recreation with facilities such as swimming pools, beach as well as boat cruising enabling them to refresh and cool themselves from heavy sunny conditions. This climatic sensitivity enables them to copeÂ  with fluctuating summer weather patterns and enjoy everyday weather patterns. However formal wear during this season is greatly tidy with dull colours. Long sleeved coats during rain season have been embraced as exhibited by the youths in different Central Business Districts. The use of dull colours as part of climate adaptation speaks volumes and weight about how much the youth shoulder the responsibility of global justice. This is due to the fact that dull colours are environment friendly especially during the summer season. Therefore to maintain favourable climate adaptation that is human friendly would require every individual to cope with changing weather patterns.
