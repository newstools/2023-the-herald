The Herald JOHANNESBURG. — MultiChoice has launched two pop-up channels, both called SWITCH’D ON, on DStv, that started on Tuesday. The new channels follow eMedia’s launch of Power-UP! — a pop-up channel on Openview that airs repeats to combat Eskom’s electricity blackouts in South Africa. With SWITCH’D ON, MultiChoice and M-Net will repeat various locally-produced shows from the Mzansi Magic, Mzansi Wethu and kykNET & Kie channels for subscribers who can’t watch during prime time due to load shedding. Content on the two SWITCH’D ON channels will repeat up to five times. WITCH’D ON on channels 109 and 110 will rebroadcast shows, including “The River”, “DiepCity”, “Gqeberha: The Empire”, “Gomora” and “Arendsvlei”. SWITCH’D ON on channel 109 will run from 6am until midnight for Premium, Compact Plus and Compact subscribers. SWITCH’D ON on channel 110 will run from 7:30am until midnight for Access and Family subscribers. Meanwhile, Channel 114 on Openview, lauched on Monday, will repeat e.tv hit prime-time shows like “Durban Gen”, “House of Zwide”, “Scandal!”, and “Imbewu” from Monday to Friday, running with 2-hour loops. The new pop-up channel that ensures viewers will never miss a show again will be on from 6am until midnight every day. “The Black Door” will repeat on weekends from 11pm, while Afrikaans telenovela true-at-hearts will also not be lost in the dark with Power-UP! showcasing omnibus repeats of all the best-loved Afrikaans dramas on weekends. “#DisComplicated”, “Daai Crazy Somer”, “Die Vertroueling”, and more will be available if you missed it during the week due to load shedding. “We’ve got you, South Africa. As a brand of our own, we believe it’s the little things we do to support households that will make a difference in the long run.” — News24.com
