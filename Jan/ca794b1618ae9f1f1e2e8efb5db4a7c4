The Herald CONCORDIA — For the second straight week, the Cloud County Community College women’s track and field team has had a student-athlete earn Kansas Jayhawk Community College Conference Women’s Track Athlete of the week with Vimbayi Maisvorewa of Zimbabwe taking home the honours for week two of the KJCCC indoor track season. The honours for Maisvorewa come following a 400-metre event winning time of 55.62 seconds at the 2023 Washburn University Rust Buster Classic in Topeka, Kansas, with the time also clearing the national qualifying standard for the 2023 NJCAA Indoor Track and Field Championships. Currently ranked third in the NJCAA in the 400 metres, Maisvorewa would go on later in the meet to anchor the T-Bird 4×400 metre relay team that would win the event with a time of 3:52.53 while running a split time of 54.61 in the final leg. Maisvorewa joins teammates Miracle Thompson and Shackala Henry to earn KJCCC Women’s Track Athlete of the Week honors this season as CCCC has had three of the four athletes of the week in women’s track this year. — Salinapost.com
