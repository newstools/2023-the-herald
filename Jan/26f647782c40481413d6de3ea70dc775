The Herald Takudzwa Chitsiga Sports Reporter AFTER successfully touring South Africa with some players selected at the homecoming football jamboree in August last year, Universal Football Management have set their sights on travelling to Amsterdam, Netherlands, from April 4. The South Africa-based football management agency managed to visit Zimbabwe and held a scouting tournament, dubbed the Homecoming Scouting Under-17 tournament. The tournament, which ran for two days, featured a field of 16 academy teams drawn from across the country and led to the selection of 18 players who toured Cape Town, South Africa. A Zimbabwean based in South Africa, UFM director Kelvin Mufuka, said he was happy to trace back to his roots after having held the tournament for the last decade in South Africa. “We are a football management company based in South Africa and last year we decided to come to our motherland, Zimbabwe, to do a scouting tournament of players, after almost 11 years hosting the tournament in South Africa. “We came up with an idea of hosting a tournament to introduce ourselves in the country and to scout for players in Zimbabwe and give them an opportunity,” said Mufuka.
