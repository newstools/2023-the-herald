The Herald Sports Reporter ZIMBABWEAN female cricket umpire Sarah Dembanevana was part of the history when she officiated in the final of the inaugural ICC Under 19 Women’s T20 World Cup won by India yesterday. Dambanevana stood with Candace la Borde of West Indies as the India Under-19 Women’s cricket team cruised to a comprehensive seven wickets victory over England in Potchefstroom. The 32-year-old Zimbabwean, who is a member of the International Panel of ICC Development Umpires, took part in more than 10 games at the Under-19 Women’s World Cup in South Africa. She was also involved in the semi-finals when she and La Borde stood as umpires in the match between England and Australia. Another Zimbabwean Owen Chirombe also took part in the semi-final match as the match referee but was not available for the final. History was made on Sunday when India became the first-ever ICC Under-19 Women’s T20 World Cup winners with that victory over England. England were put in to bat first after losing the toss and were bowled out for 68 runs in 17.1 overs. In response, India raced to a comfortable victory when they put on 69 runs for the loss of just three in 14 overs.
