Mobile network operator, NetOne Cellular has lost airtime worth nearly $566 million to its employees who were conniving with some airtime dealers since last month. Police have since arrested four suspects in connection with the case. National police spokesperson Assistant Commissioner Paul Nyathi confirmed the arrests. “The Zimbabwe Republic Police confirms the arrest of Primrose Maireti (32), James Mwanza (35), Kumbulani Nyapfumbi (30), and Simbarashe Mandimutsira (27) for allegedly stealing pin-less credit airtime from NetOne Cellular (Private) Limited and then sell it at a higher discount than the company to dealers. “Police detectives teamed up with NetOne Loss Control and Fraud Management Unit to track the suspects leading to the arrest of James Mwanza. Checks made confirmed that James Mwanza received $50 000 000 worth of pin-less airtime from the deal. He implicated Primrose Maireti and others,” he said. Police have established that a total of $565 999 964.00 worth of airtime was stolen from December 3, 2022, to January 19, 2023. NetOne employees were sharing the loot with the airtime dealers. Police have since recovered a Honda Fit motor vehicle registration number AFW 6813 from Kumbulani Nyapfumbi, which was bought using proceeds from the loot. “Investigations have also revealed that he bought a residential stand for US$11 000 and another Honda Fit vehicle chassis number GE6-1744428 for US$3 971. The vehicle is on its way from Japan. The Zimbabwe Republic Police will ensure that company employees and their accomplices face the full wrath of the law for fraudulent activities,” Asst Comm Nyathi said.
