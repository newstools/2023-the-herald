The Herald Loice Vavi Health Matters Definition It is a yeast infection of the vagina and tissues at the vulva or opening of the vagina. Candida lives on skin and inside the body without causing any problems. It can only cause infection if conditions change inside the vulva to encourage its growth. Causes Wearing scented tampons or using vaginal deodorant Prolonged use of antibiotics or unnecessary use. Pregnancy and hormones — changes in hormones can disrupt the normal PH balance of candida in vagina. Using contraceptive pills. Changes that took place during menstrual cycle. Uncontrolled or poorly controlled Diabetes Mellitus — high blood sugar levels can cause yeast to overgrow. Immunosuppression — because of reduced ability to fight infections for example people living with HIV and AIDS and people on cancer treatment. Using certain steroids. Symptoms Burning sensation on urinating. Redness and swelling of the vagina and vulva. Thick, white odour free vaginal discharge. Itchy and burning sensation in vagina and vulva. Sometimes painful sexual intercourse Vaginal rash. Prevention Avoid tight fitting pantyhose. Wear cotton under wear. Maintain blood sugar levels within normal ranges if you have Diabetic Mellitus.
