The Herald DUBLIN. — Ireland all-rounder Tyrone Kane is determined to seize his chance in his first senior cricket tour to Zimbabwe after being recalled to the squad. Kane (28) debuted for Ireland in a T20 International against Scotland in 2015 and has 10 caps to date, which includes playing in Ireland Men’s inaugural Test Match in 2018. While the Zimbabwe tour will be his first senior tour for Ireland, Kane has been overseas on several Ireland Wolves tours and was part of the Ireland Under-19s team at the ICC Under-19 Men’s World Cup in 2012, when he finished highest run-scorer for Ireland at the tournament and claimed five wickets. Since his last international in July 2019 — coincidentally against Zimbabwe — Kane made changes in his game, which were partly spurred by two key moves to reinvigorate his career in 2021 — at Inter-Provincial level he moved from Leinster Lightning to Munster Reds, and at club level he switched from Merrion CC to Phoenix CC. Part of the Munster Reds first-ever title winning IP50 side, Kane came particularly to the fore in the T20 format with the bat where he struck 203 runs at 40.60 at a strike rate of 169.17. He was the fourth highest run-scorer for the competition, striking 16 sixes along the way (the second-most of any batter). Speaking about his international recall, Kane said: “Yeah, I was thrilled to get the call from Andrew White (National Selector), it felt brilliant to get the nod to be back involved. “I was always determined to get back into the fold, but knew I needed some performances to back it up. So thankfully I held up my end of the bargain and now have another chance to make an impact on the international stage.” Asked about the improvements in his game in recent seasons, he added: “There wasn’t a deliberate plan to changing my game as such, I’ve always been capable of scoring quickly and hitting sixes, but more so it was about the consistency over the last year is something I’ve been working towards.
