The Herald In the fourth quarter, Tesla reported deliveries of 405 278 vehicles and production of 439 701 vehicles. That brings Tesla’s 2022 full year deliveries to around 1,31 million vehicles. In 2021, Tesla reported 308 600 vehicle deliveries in the fourth quarter, and full-year deliveries of around 936 172 vehicles. Deliveries are the closest approximation of sales disclosed by Tesla. These numbers represented a new record for the Elon Musk-led automaker and growth of 40 percent in deliveries year-over-year. However, the fourth quarter numbers fell shy of analysts’ expectations. According to a consensus of analysts’ estimates compiled by FactSet, as of December 31, 2022 Wall Street was expecting Tesla to report deliveries around 427 000 for the final quarter of the year. Estimates updated in December, and included in the FactSet consensus, ranged from 409 000 to 433 000. Tesla started production at two new factories this year — in Austin, Texas and Brandenburg, Germany — and ramped up production in Fremont, California and in Shanghai, but it does not disclose production and delivery numbers by region.
