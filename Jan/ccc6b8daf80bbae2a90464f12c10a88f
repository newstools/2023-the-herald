The Herald RIYADH. — Fans have ripped into “finished fraud” Cristiano Ronaldo as his Al-Nassr move went from bad to worse on Thursday night. Ronaldo made his second start for the club against Al-Ittihad in the semi-finals of the Saudi Super Cup, having joined Al-Nassr on a free transfer at the start of this month. However, the five-time Ballon d’Or winner was unable to prevent his new side from crashing out of the competition as they fell to a 3-1 defeat in Riyadh. Fans were soon to take to social media to mock Ronaldo for his lack of success since arriving in Saudi Arabia. One tweeted: “Ronaldo influence. Al-Nassr is being cooked by a mid-table club in Saudi Arabia.” Another wrote: “Ronaldo’s holding Al-Nassr back. They need a new striker.” A third fan added: “Let’s laugh at Ronaldo.” Meanwhile, one more commented: “Ronaldo has been awful I’m not going to lie.” The ridicule continued, as another said: “Ronaldo is not even good enough for the Saudi Pro League and he had the nerve to question Erik ten Hag for not starting him every game in the Premier League. Sold his soul and legacy for money. Finished player and fanbase.” That sentiment was echoed, with one fan adding: “They terminated Aboubakar’s contract for this finished fraud.” Another joked: “Cristiano Ronaldo can’t reach the level of the strong competitive Saudi league.” — The Daily Star.
