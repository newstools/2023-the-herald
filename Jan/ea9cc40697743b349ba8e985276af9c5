The Herald Takudzwa Chitsiga-Sports Reporter SIMBA Bhora have officially appointed former Dynamos coach Tonderai Ndiraya as their substantive head coach after he signed a three-year contract. Ndiraya will join the Shamva-based side which gained promotion into the Castle Lager Premier Soccer League after winning the ZIFA Northern Region Division One League title last year. Simba Bhora have been under the guidance of Arthur Tutani who will take up the assistant coach’s role. Ndiraya, whose contract with Dynamos lapsed on Saturday night after the club decided against extending it at the conclusion of last season, takes over from Tutani who is ineligible to coach in the Premier Soccer League as he doesn’t possess the requisite CAF A coaching licence. Simba Bhora secretary-general Taurai Janhi said they have appointed Ndiraya as their head coach on a three-year contract. “We, as Simba Bhora, are delighted to announce the appointment of Tonderai Ndiraya as the head coach of Simba Bhora on a three-year contract. We settled for Ndiraya because we believe he has the qualities that we need in a coach. “Ndiraya is a coach who is development oriented, believes in giving a chance to upcoming players and is focused on growth. With his experience, having coached at Dynamos and Ngezi Platinum Stars, we believe he will be able to usher us into the Premier Soccer League,” Janhi stated. Janhi also highlighted that Simba Bhora are in the process of upgrading their home ground Wadzanai so that they host their Premiership matches in Shamva this season. “We are already in the process of upgrading Wadzanai stadium so that we play all our home matches in Shamva. Our team is also a vehicle for the marketing and development of Shamva and the whole of Mashonaland Central Province. We have future plans to make Shamva and Mashonaland Central Province the epicentre of football development in Zimbabwe,” he added.
