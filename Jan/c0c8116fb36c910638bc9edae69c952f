The court heard on July 16, police intelligence received information that Mupanduki was procuring dagga from outside the country and hiding it inside the fowl run. Police visited Makore’s house to conduct a search of the fowl run which was at the back of the main house. Makore indicated that he had no keys but police forced open the fowl run and recovered five sacks of dagga. Makore was asked to produce any document or licence that authorised him to possess the dagga, but he stated that Mupanduki was responsible for the fowl run.
