The Herald London. —Chelsea complete signing of Mykhailo Mudryk in huge £88m deal on a EIGHT-AND-A-HALF year contract from Shakhtar Donetsk after hijacking Arsenal’s move for the 22-year-old highly-rated Ukrainian winger  Chelsea have completed a stunning £88million move for Ukrainian winger Mykhailo Mudryk from Shakhtar Donetsk on a massive eight-and-a-half-year deal. The west London club beat Arsenal at the 11th hour to the transfer, with their deal preferable to the Ukrainian club both in terms of the outlay and the way it was structured. Having led the race for months — with the player making little secret of his desire to join Arsenal on social media — the Premier League leaders were beaten to his signature by Chelsea. Mudryk was paraded on the pitch at half time of Sunday’s clash with Crystal Palace and watched the game from a box in the stands. — Dailymailsport.
