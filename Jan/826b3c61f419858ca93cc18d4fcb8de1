The Herald Ellina Mhlanga Senior Sports Reporter MR Pace Athletics Club chairperson Collen Makaza says they are looking forward to an eventful season and have lined up a number of events for the year. The club is scheduled to host seven events this year that have been included on the national calendar. The major highlight for the club is the track and field championships, returning after taking a break last year. Most of their events are road races. “We have about seven events on the national calendar this year. Last year we had about four and we didn’t have the track and field due to sponsorship challenges. “But this year we have got some sponsors that have come on board. We recently had our first meeting to confirm the partnership. “We want more of our athletes to qualify for major competitions such as the Olympics. For us to do that as a country we need to create more opportunities for our athletes to participate, that’s how they can improve their times. That’s why we are trying to come up with more competition,” said Makaza. They will hold their first competition, a cross-country event, this coming weekend. It will be followed by the track and field championships in March. They will then stage the Mr Pace 10km road race in May and Mr Pace – Mashwede road race in June. In August they have the Mr Pace Heroes 21km race. Mr Pace Chitungwiza 21km is set for October and will conclude their programme with a 10km Christmas Challenge in November.
