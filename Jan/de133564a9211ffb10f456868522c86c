The Herald LONDON. — Ex-England and Arsenal star Paul Merson thinks Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang’s career at English Premiership football giants Chelsea is over already. The Gabonese hitman arrived from Barcelona on deadline day in September and has yet to establish a long-term spot in Chelsea’s front-line. Having only scored three goals in 16 matches across all competitions this campaign, Aubameyang has been dropped in favour of German international Kai Havertz up front, with Graham Potter eager to turn around Chelsea’s poor run of form. The Blues sit 10th in the Premier League table and were knocked out of the FA Cup following their comprehensive 4-0 thrashing against Manchester City on Sunday. Aubameyang was hooked off during Chelsea’s English Premier League fixture against the reigning champions last Thursday and subsequently dropped out of Potter’s squad for the FA Cup third round clash at the weekend. ‘’Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang was taken off after coming on as a substitute in the first game against Man City and I think he will now be moved on. I think they will cut their ties with him,’’ Merson urged in his column for Sky Sports. ‘’As soon as you are sub-subbing a 30-something player, I think that is probably the end. ‘’Maybe you can get away with it with a younger player, but in football it’s one of those unwritten rules. It’s a don’t-do. ‘’But Potter did it with him at 33 and, for me, I think he’s done.’’ The forward was once considered one of the world’s best goal-scorers whilst at Arsenal, netting 92 times in 163 appearances for the club, but his career took a turn following his fallout with Gunners boss Mikel Arteta. After his acrimonious exit from the Emirates in January 2022, Aubameyang netted 13 goals in 24 appearances at the Nou Camp, enticing Chelsea into pursuing his signature during the summer window. — Mailonline
