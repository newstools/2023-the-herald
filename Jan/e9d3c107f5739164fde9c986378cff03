The Herald President Cyril Ramaphosa is likely to make a decision on a cabinet reshuffle at the end of January, ANC deputy president Paul Mashatile says. He said the move was inevitable and would take place after the ordinary sitting of the ANC’s national executive committee (NEC) and the ANC NEC lekgotla at the end of January. “We’re going to have the lekgotla of the NEC (and) finalise the plans. Once we are done, the president will then begin to look at where he should make changes,” said Mashatile. Ramaphosa is expected to axe some ministers who did not make the new NEC cut and introduce newcomers to the structure. Mashatile said the reshuffle would be necessary because some members might leave, including secretary-general Fikile Mbalula. “The secretary-general has to be full time at Luthuli House, so at some point he has to leave. The president will then begin to look at what to do next, but we thought we shouldn’t rush to make changes before we finalise our plan,” Mashatile added. Speaking at the ANC’s presidential golf day in Mangaung in the Free State, Ramaphosa said he would not give in to media pressure to reshuffle the cabinet. “That is the most pre-eminent thing in your thoughts.” — BusinessDay.
