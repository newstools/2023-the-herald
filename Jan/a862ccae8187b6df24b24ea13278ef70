The Herald Yeukai Karengezeka Court Correspondent A Harare couple was yesterday granted separate protection orders against the man’s ex-wife who allegedly insults and causes pandemonium at the couple’s workplaces. Mr Matter Tanyanyiwa took his ex-wife, Memory Madondo, to the Harare Civil Court to settle the dispute that has been destabilising his marriage and work. Magistrate Ms Tamara Chibindi ordered Madondo not to insult or harass Mr Tanyanyiwa. She also forbade her from visiting his workplace and place of residence. Mr Tanyanyiwa told the court that despite separating 20 years ago, his ex-wife never gave him peace of mind. “I divorced her in 2002 and I pay maintenance but she regularly visits my workplace only to insult me using vulgar language. “She also does the same things to my current wife,” he said. However, Madondo denied the allegations saying she only visited his workplace to drop a letter. “I have never insulted him. I have never seen him for years; I only visited him last year at his workplace to hand over a letter. “I wanted him to stop spending donor money that was being sent on his phone for our child who is disabled,” she said. Madondo said if she wanted to cause havoc, she would visit his home because Mr Tanyanyiwa married a woman who lived at a house opposite theirs. Mr Tanyanyiwa’s wife, Ms Tabeth Masawi, also complained that Madondo visits her workplace at the Social Welfare offices and causes drama. “She came to my workplace four times and asked me for the kids and I told her to speak to my husband. “In another incident, she grabbed me by the collar at a shop and she always comes to insult me at my workplace,” said Ms Masawi. Ms Chibindi ordered Madondo not to insult or harass Ms Masawi and forbade her from visiting her workplace.
