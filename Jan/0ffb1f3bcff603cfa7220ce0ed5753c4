The Herald Sports Reporter LONG-DISTANCE runner Olivia Chitate has stepped up her preparations for the forthcoming World Athletics Cross Country Championships that are taking place on February 18 in Bathurst, Australia. Chitate earned the ticket to represent the country when she won the national championships more than a week ago in Bindura. She will be joined by Blessing Waison, who will compete in the men’s section. The two athletes are chasing qualification for the 10 000m event, for the World Championships to be held in August. They are targeting the top 10 to qualify. “So far preparations are going well. We are working hard so that we try and push to meet the target. The target is top 10. “I have competed in cross-country events only so far. The times are not so good, so we are working hard to take off some time,” said Chitate. Chitate, however, said preparing for such major competitions requires more time. “What happens with us is that our preparations are always on a short notice. If we can get more time, I think we can do better. But I am doing my best to prepare. “We are working on my speed, that’s our main focus area because I have been running marathon, so I need to improve my speed,” said Chitate.
