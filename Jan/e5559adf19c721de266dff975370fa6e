The Herald Sports Reporter ZIMBABWE junior men’s handball team captain Kudakwashe Soka is looking forward to improving his game after participating at the International Handball Federation Trophy continental phase recently. Soka led the team at the continental showpiece in Congo that also featured the youth. Zimbabwe competed in the junior section against hosts Congo, Nigeria, Guinea, Rwanda and Madagascar. They returned home winless after losing all their matches at the tournament which was played in a round robin format. Soka said although they found the going tough, the event was a good platform for exposure as he looks forward to graduate to the seniors. “The exposure I got there is important because I now know where I need to improve and work on. My fitness level is low and I need to work extra hard to catch up with the guys we met. “I need to work extra hard so I can get better when I graduate into the senior team,” said Soka. Zimbabwe were taking part at the continental level for the first time after winning the regional tournament last year.
