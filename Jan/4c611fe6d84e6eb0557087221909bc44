The Herald A YEAR of two halves started with Zimbabwe’s men’s cricket team losing 11 of their first 14 international fixtures in 2022 — including series defeats to Afghanistan and Namibia — before winning 13 of their next 25 matches. The difference? A change in coach. Dave Houghton, the country’s first Test captain, had an immediate impact after he replaced Lalchand Rajput — who moved sideways into the position of technical director — in June. Zimbabwe won the T20 World Cup Qualifier, held at home, a month later and earned a spot at an ICC event for the first time since 2016. They also had an impressive run through the T20 World Cup, where they got into the Super 12. They also beat Bangladesh in an ODI series for the first time since 2013 and won an ODI in Australia for the first time ever, but remain out of automatic contention for the 2023 World Cup.
