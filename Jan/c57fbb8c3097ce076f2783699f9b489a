The majority of schools in Harare have opened smoothly today with learners and teachers from the public as well as private schools having shown up. A snap survey carried out today showed that new learners in Grade One and Form One classes were undergoing orientation while the rest of the classes were getting down to business. At George Stark in Mbare and Hillbright Sciences College, there was a 100 percent teacher turnout while no learner was being sent home for non-payment of school fees. <img class="size-medium wp-image-664437" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/01/Headmaster-1-360x203.jpg" alt="" width="360" height="203" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/01/Headmaster-1-360x203.jpg 360w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/01/Headmaster-1-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/01/Headmaster-1-680x383.jpg 680w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/01/Headmaster-1.jpg 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px" /> George Stark School Head Masimba Mupavaenda shaves the heads of learners with unkempt hair.
