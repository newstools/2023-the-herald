The Herald Conrad Mupesa–Mashonaland West Bureau A KAROI man has been taken to court for occupying 262 hectares of land in Hurungwe district using an allegedly forged offer letter. Mr Tichafa Vincent Tendayi, who holds a serialised and marked offer letter from the Ministry of Lands, Agriculture, Fisheries, Water and Rural Development has taken Chenjerai Kangausaru to court seeking his removal from the farm. Kangausaru is occupying Subdivision 1 of Chitonga Farm in Hurungwe East Constituency, which is said to be legally held by Mr Tendayi, who was issued with an offer letter on November 3, 2014. While Kangausaru claims to have an offer letter from the Lands Ministry signed by former Minister, Dr Douglas Mombeshora in February of 2014, verification by the Acting Director of Lands and Administration a Mr C Magauze, confirmed that this was allegedly fraudulently obtained. Kangausaru submitted two offer letters to the Hurungwe District Lands Committee which were issued by Dr Mombeshora, but with different signatures. The committee failed to deal with the conflict. But records show that Mr Tendayi is the person recognised by the Lands Ministry. “The Ministry records show that you (Mr Tendayi) are still the beneficiary of Subdivision 1 of Chitonga measuring 262 hectares in Hurungwe District. “Your offer letter of 3 November 2014 was only withdrawn on 12 March 2015 to correct your initial and surname and a replacement offer letter was done on the same day. “C. Kangausaru does not have an offer letter for Subdivision 1 of Chitonga, according to ministry records,” said Mr Magauze, in a letter dated January 4, 2022 written to Mr Tendayi. On January 5, 2022 Kangausaru submitted a copy of the alleged forged offer letter that was certified by a commissioner of oaths, NM Mutsvairo, to the Karoi Magistrates Court in his supplementary affidavit. The case is expected to be heard at Karoi Magistrates Court tomorrow.
