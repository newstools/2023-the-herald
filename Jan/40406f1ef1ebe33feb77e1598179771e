THE National Social Security Authority (NSSA) has reversed the appointment of acting general manager on rotational basis following advice that the timing “may not be right” since the audit is not yet complete. On Tuesday this week, NSSA issued a public notice signed by the board chair Dr Percy Toriro advising that they had appointed one of their directors, Ms Agnes Masiiwa as the new acting general manager taking over from Dr  Charles Shava. Dr Toriro had indicated that the appointment of acting general manager would be rotational until a substantive general manager is appointed. However, the authority yesterday released another public notice rescinding the earlier move. “Further to our notice indicating the intention to rotate the acting NSSA general manager position after the incumbent had acted for six months, we have been advised that the timing may not be right since the audit process is not yet complete. “We have been advised to let the incumbent acting general manager continue in the position,” reads part of the notice. NSSA is a corporate body tasked by the Government to provide social security. As a social security fund manager, the authority looks after billions of dollars contributed by workers during their years of active employment as well as investments from compulsory collections. The provision of social security entails instituting public policy measures intended to protect an individual in life situations or conditions in which his/her livelihood and wellbeing may be threatened, for example, due to sickness, workplace injuries, unemployment, invalidity, old age, retirement and death.
