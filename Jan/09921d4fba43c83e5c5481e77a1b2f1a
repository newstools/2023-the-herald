The Herald Sports Reporter THE highly anticipated third and the final ODI between Zimbabwe and Ireland has been called off due to persistent rain at Harare Sports Club. Officials were left with no option but to call off the game after the on-and-off showers made it impossible for the game to go ahead. Zimbabwe won the toss and decided to bat first. But only 13 overs were played before the rain descended at the ground and caused a delay of more than four hours. The abandonment meant that the two teams shared the three-match ODI contest 1-1. Zimbabwe had won the opening encounter by three wickets last week but Ireland bounced back on Saturday with a deserved 76 runs victory that kept the series alive.
