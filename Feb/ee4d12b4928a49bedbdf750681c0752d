While Freeman said he was too busy to comment, sungura ace Ngwazi, who recently launched his new album at Bar Rogue, Long Chen, was he on cloud nine due to the recognition of his efforts. “I am short of words,” he said. “I feel humbled and very excited for being nominated on NAMA awards, it motivates me and the team to do more. If I look at the past I feel greatly honoured. “I would like to salute my fans and promoters for believing in me since day one, keep supporting me. This year we are working on new projects, We are yet to finalise if it will be an album or singles.” Below is the full list of all the nominees. 21st NAMA NOMINEES DANCE AWARDS Outstanding Female Dancer Praise Dube in Ngomdladla the dunamis Ndomupeishe Chipendo in Teleunga Lesley Mushaninga in Silently Complicated Outstanding Male Dancer Terrence Kapesa in A Kid from Bulawayo Sean Mambwere in Silently complicated Devante Sangaza in A Champion’s year Outstanding Dance Group Khaya Arts in Ngomdladla the Dunamis Salt and Light in A Kid from Bulawayo Elysium Magna Dance Theatre in The Birth of Christ Outstanding Dance Choreographer Future Dube in Ngomdladla the Dunamis Sean Mambwere in Silently Complicated Hillary Indi in The Birth of Christ VISUAL ARTS AWARDS Outstanding 3 Dimensional Work Working Together by Bernard Sakarombe Celebrating Together by Taurai Chinofura Life is a Journey by Charles Manyaura Reflection by Strive Matimura Outstanding Mixed Media Looking Behind the Pot by Keith Zenda Mysterical Revealer by Terrence Musekiwa A Long Way 2 by Justin Gope Outstanding Exhibition Bold and Beautiful by Keith Zenda curated by Philip Butler & Keith Zenda A Book that Cannot be Read by Allison Baker curated by Fadzai Muchemwa Roots and Routes by Tamari & Natasha Kudita curated by Doreen Sibanda SPOKEN WORD AWARDS Outstanding Poet Sithembile Siqoza Obert Dube Prince Ryanne Chidzvondo Ngoni Paradza aka Mambo Guramatunhu Outstanding Comedian King Kandoro Andrew Manyika Tanyaradzwa Sena Outstanding Social Media Skits Admire Mushambi aka Mama Vee Kudzanai Chengedza aka Mbuya vaPiyasoni Theophilus Chigumira aka Mai Kirifodhi MEDIA AWARDS Outstanding Journalist – Print Khumbulani Muleya – The Standard Nyadzombe Nyampenza – The Standard Tafadzwa Zimoyo – The Herald Outstanding Journalist – Radio Owen Madondo – Star FM Anesu Masamvu – ZiFM Yvonne Tivatye – Star FM Outstanding Journalist – Television Candice Mwakalyalya – ZTN Colette Musanyera – ZBC Takudzwa Chihambakwe – ZTN Outstanding – Online Media Nash TV Bustop TV Earground THEATRE AWARDS Outstanding Actor Shaun Mundawarara as Cullingwall in The Play that goes Wrong Musa Saruro as Charles in The Play that goes Wrong Ishmael Muvingi as King Lobengula in Bayethe Nkosi Outstanding Actress Caroline Yule as Mrs Perkins in The Play that goes Wrong Min’enhle Mguni as Renee Stokes in Heartbreak Mafia Sandra Mpofu as Maimbodeyi in Maimbodeyi Outstanding Theatrical Production Heartbreak Mafia by Reps Theatre The play that goes wrong by Reps Theatre Bayethe Nkosi by Umkhathi Theatre Outstanding Director Matesu Dube in Bayethe Nkosi AneUnhu Gwatidzo in Heartbreak Mafia Sue Bolt in The Play that Goes Wrong LITERARY AWARDS Outstanding First Creative Published Work The Madman on First Street and other stories by David Chasumba 3.15am and other stories by Rudo D.M Manyere Monomotapa by Tawanda Vomo Outstanding Children’s Book When the Sun Sets by Nqobizwe Malinga Let’s enjoy Village Tales with Mbuya maDishi by Valentine N.Nyagweta Sloba and the Chameleonaire by Costa Chayambuka Outstanding Fiction Book The Quality of Mercy by Siphiwe Gloria Ndlovu Intwasa Short Stories Vol. 2 edited by Raisedon Baya Chapwati by Ignatius C.
