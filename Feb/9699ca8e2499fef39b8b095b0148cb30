The Herald LONDON. — Former Arsenal and Manchester City midfielder Patrick Vieira has named who he thinks will win the English Premier League football title this season. Following their 3-1 win at the Emirates, City went top of the table as it appeared that Arsenal’s title push was falling apart. But last weekend, the Gunners regained the lead after beating Aston Villa 4-2 while City were held to a 1-1 draw at Nottingham Forest, and now have a two-point advantage over their rivals with a game in hand. And thanks to a 3-0 win over Leicester, Manchester United also remain surprise contenders in the race for the title. For many, it is still way too early to call who will be champions come the end of May, but not for the legendary Vieira, who captained Arsenal to their last English Premier League title 19 years ago. Though he has ties to both Arsenal and City, he is extremely confident that the north London club will emerge victorious. ‘’I think the Premier League title is Arsenal’s to lose, to be honest with you,’’ the current Crystal Palace manager told William Hill. ‘’I think Arsenal did really well against Aston Villa on Saturday, to bounce back with that 4-2 win at Villa Park. They are just in a really good place at the moment, with a lot of confidence. ‘’But I still believe Manchester City will chase Arsenal until the very last day of the Premier League season. But I think it’s Arsenal’s title to lose.’’ One of Arsenal’s greatest ever players, Vieira was a part of all three of the club’s English Premier League triumphs, skippering the ‘’Invincibles’’ side of 2003/04. He later wound down his career at the Etihad, retiring shortly after winning the FA Cup with City in 2011. And the French World Cup winner could well play a huge part in this season’s title race with his Palace side set to take on both his former clubs in the next month. — Metro
