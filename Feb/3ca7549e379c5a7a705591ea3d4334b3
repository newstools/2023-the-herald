The Herald Sara Delgado Selena Gomez is a fountain of knowledge and inspiration, and she often shares it with the world, whether it’s via viral makeup tricks or during one-on-one life-changing counseling sessions. Now, the superstar is keeping her advice close to home, sharing why exactly she wouldn’t want her little sister (aka her “forever favorite human”) going into the entertainment industry. As one of the stars of Vanity Fair’s 2023 Hollywood Issue, Selena discussed the pros and cons of fame and power, looking back on her career and the lessons she has learned so far. During her interview, Sel was asked to share the best piece of advice she has for Hollywood newcomers, and she took the opportunity to open up about the industry as a whole and how perilous it can be for young and impressionable individuals. “All I can say is, I would love to be there for you if you ever have questions. But this industry is a beast,” explained Selena. “It’s really scary to see what happens when you’re given so much power and money at a young age. I think it’s extremely scary.” “The bigger you get, the more humble I would encourage you to be,” Selena continued. “Hold on to your heart, try to be the best you can be, and be careful about who to trust because you are who you surround yourself with. “My sister’s nine, and thank God she doesn’t want to be in this industry. Actually, that’s her now. What if she tells me in two years she wants to? I can’t even think about it.” Selena Gomez also opened up about the pressure she faced while being a young star and how her perception of what’s important has gradually shifted over the years. “I wasn’t a wild child by any means, but I was on Disney, so I had to make sure not to say ‘What the hell?’ in front of anyone. It’s stuff that I was also putting on myself to be the best role model I could be,” she said. “Now I think being the best role model is being honest, even with the ugly and complicated parts of yourself.” So true.
