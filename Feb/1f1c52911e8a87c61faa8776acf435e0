The Herald Nomxolisi Museta Lifestyle Correspondent The growth and expansion of the tourism and hospitality sector in Zimbabwe is set to bring major changes, with some of the biggest hospitality groups working on refurbishments that are set to reposition their hotels in order to give the best guest experience for both local and international visitors. In Nyanga, Troutbeck Resort is bringing more hope and life to the tourism and hospitality sector in Zimbabwe. Marrying the traditional Troutbeck feel with a blend of classic and contemporary style, the completion of refurbishments at the resort are proving to be fruitful. Following the decision to commit a significant amount of capital towards sprucing up the image of its hotels, African Sun Limited has announced the near completion of refurbishments at one of their most loved resorts in Nyanga. Troutbeck Resort has bounced back with more ambience and character in anticipation of a tourism rebound after the challenges experienced by the tourism and hospitality sector after the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic. “The first phase of refurbishments kicked off back in 2019 just before the Covid-19 outbreak where we started working on the public areas like the restaurant, the kitchen and lobby areas,” Troutbeck general manager Raymond Mavhumashava said. “The scope of the refurbishments entailed stripping of all the 70 rooms at the resort, including the public spaces. From the ceilings, the plastering to the wiring, we saw it fit to re-design and add a modern touch to our resort. “However we made sure that the character of traditional Troutbeck was maintained as we all know that this place is a country resort and we made sure that we still moved in line with the original theme.” <img class="size-medium wp-image-674651 aligncenter" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/02/Untitled-64.fqrfqrfqf-360x201.jpg" alt="" width="360" height="201" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/02/Untitled-64.fqrfqrfqf-360x200.jpg 360w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/02/Untitled-64.fqrfqrfqf.jpg 680w" sizes="(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px" /> A whopping US$2 million is said to have gone towards the refurbishment of the hotel and it is quite evident as the hotel is nothing short of perfection. Guest areas like the lounge, restaurant and reception have been furnished, with more modern pieces mixed with gentle touch ups of the old traditional Troutbeck pieces. Troutbeck Resort is perfectly positioned to explore the scenic beauty of Nyanga and savour the crisp mountain air around it. The resort takes its name from its famous trout filled lake situated right at the foot of the ancient pine tree hills which tower over the hotel. “The refurbishments have brought a significant change to traffic at the hotel, we have always housed both local and international tourists,” said Mavhumashava. “The renovations will definitely boost sales and I think I can safely say we are now one of the resort destinations of choice in the country.” The marketing officer of the resort, Carol Mutasa, talked about the several activities offered at the hotel. <img class="size-medium wp-image-674653 aligncenter" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/02/adfa-360x201.jpg" alt="" width="360" height="201" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/02/adfa-360x200.jpg 360w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/02/adfa.jpg 680w" sizes="(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px" /> “We have several activities offered at the resort,” she said. “Apart from recent infrastructural developments, we offer a range of activities that cater for everyone and sets us out from the rest. “We have activities like horse riding, quad biking, several water activities like fly fishing of trout, boat cruises and to top it up, we are the proud hosts of the triathlon. Our guests are guaranteed of a memorable stay.” Xoli Mthethwa, a guest at the Resort said she was very happy with the new refurbishments. “I have always made it a point to come and visit the hotel at least once a year and this is actually my first time back ever since the pandemic hit,” she said. “To say I’m impressed is an understatement, the new designs blew my mind. “What amazes me is how it still feels like the old Troutbeck, but with a slightly different more modern look. I love how they did not take away that classic home feel we all love.” The green scenery topped with the sound of the waterfalls up on the mountains connects guests with nature, while giving them luxurious and soft touch hospitality space. “We love working with people and try to keep all our occupants happy,” Charlene Mtezo, head of marketing said. “We offer top of the range guest services,that way we know our guests will definitely want a second visit.” The picturesque valley lane makes for a fun filled and memorable road trip which is sure to take you away from the buzz of the busy city life.
