The Herald Zvamaida Murwira Senior Reporter President Mnangagwa has left the country for Addis Ababa, Ethiopia where he will join other African leaders for the 36th Ordinary Session of the African Union summit that will tackle political, economic and social issues affecting the continent. He is also expected to hold bilateral meetings with other leaders aimed at deepening cooperation. Running under the Theme, “The year of AfCFTA. Acceleration of the African Continental Free Trade Area Implementation,” the summit will tackle ways to deepen regional integration and trade within the context of the free trade area. The African Continental Free Trade Area seeks to eliminate trade barriers in Africa, reducing poverty by boosting intra-African trade. To boost regional integration and trade, the AfCFTA has this year identified five priority areas, tourism, transport, business services, communication services, financial services, transport services, and Tourism and Travel-related services. The ultimate objective is to ensure that AfCFTA is truly operational and the gains from the initiative are improved implementation in order to achieve increased inter-regional and intra-Africa trade that would yield economic development for the betterment of the continent at large. <img class="size-medium wp-image-673057" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/02/HE-3-360x201.jpg" alt="" width="360" height="201" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/02/HE-3-360x200.jpg 360w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/02/HE-3.jpg 680w" sizes="(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px" /> President Mnangagwa has left the country for Addis Ababa, Ethiopia to attend the 36th Ordinary Session of the African Union summit.
