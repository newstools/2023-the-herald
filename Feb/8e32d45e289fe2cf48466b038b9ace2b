The Herald Yeukai Karengezeka-Court Correspondent A Harare woman on Tuesday successfully approached the Harare Civil Court seeking a peace order against another woman who lives in her neighbourhood, who allegedly insults and assaults her often. Ms Tanaka Mpua told magistrate Ms Tamara Chibindi that she no longer had dignity in the community because of the way Taizivei Nyakuvhura mistreated her. “Whenever this woman sees me, she calls me a prostitute and claims that I am an ART (anti-retroviral therapy) beneficiary,” she said. “I do not have peace of mind because whenever I am passing by the road, she laughs at me and now people in my community treat me with disdain.” On numerous occasions, Ms Mpua said she was insulted and whenever her child went to play with other kids at Ms Nyakuvhura’s house, she chased her away while calling her a child of a woman of loose morals. In response, Ms Nyakuvhura denied the allegations, arguing that it was Ms Mpua who harassed her and assaulted her. “She is lying,” she said. “I have never assaulted her before. We go to the same church, but she tells the community that my husband and I have been living on ART for the past eight years. Recently, she poured dirty water on me and threw some stones at me.” In her ruling, Ms Chibindi ordered Ms Nyakuvhura not to insult, harass or assault Ms Mpua.
