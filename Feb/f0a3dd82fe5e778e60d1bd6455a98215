The Herald BEIJING. – China unveiled its key policy document or No. 1 central document for 2023 on Monday, vowing to launch a special campaign against problems including exorbitant “bride prices” and extravagant wedding ceremonies as part of nationwide efforts to strengthen the construction of public cultural-ethical standards in the country’s rural areas. The document encouraged local governments to formulate norms for changing outdated customs in light of local conditions, strengthen the role of village rules and conventions in restraining bad behaviour, and party members and officials to take the lead in setting examples. The “bride price” is a traditional Chinese prerequisite for marriage. Giving a “bride price” as a betrothal gift has a long history in China as a goodwill gesture between the couple and their two families. However, the “bride price” has risen from a token amount to very high levels, particularly in poorer areas, and the nature of the traditional custom has changed a lot over the years. Some families in rural areas or low-income families have to use up their savings for their sons to get married. Some young couples, once in a good relationship, have fallen out over high betrothal prices, and some have broken up. Recently, many cities and provinces across China have intensified their efforts to rein in exorbitant “bride prices”. Last September, eight national departments jointly issued a notice to address the problems of excessive “bride prices” and extravagant wedding ceremonies in rural areas, rolling out a special work plan for a nationwide campaign. – Global Times.
