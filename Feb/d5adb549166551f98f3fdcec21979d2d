The Herald PALM BEACH GARDENS. — Chris Kirk waited nearly eight years to win a PGA Tour event again. Waiting one more hole on Sunday was no problem. Kirk stuck his approach to the par-5 18th to tap-in range, and his birdie on the first hole of a playoff lifted him past Eric Cole for the victory at the Honda Classic on Sunday. Cole had a chance, playing his third shot from the sand to just outside of 10 feet for a birdie that would have extended the playoff. But it lipped out, and Kirk nudged his ball in for his fifth career win — his first since prevailing at Colonial in 2015. “I was obviously very, very nervous today having not won in so long,” Kirk said. “Coming down the stretch, I felt good.” And he’ll be the last Honda winner. The car company is ending its title sponsorship of the event after 42 years, with a new sponsor set to be in place — the PGA Tour hopes, anyway — in the coming weeks. They finished 72 holes tied at 14-under 266, Kirk shooting 69 on Sunday, Cole shooting 67. Kirk earned US$1 512 000 for the win, and is now eligible to play the Masters again for the first time since 2016. Cole earned US$915 600 for the runner-up finish, a cheque that more than doubles what the 34-year-old has earned in 14 previous tour starts. “I loved it. It was a lot of fun,” Cole said. “I can’t wait to get back and do it again. I didn’t have my best stuff today, and I was proud of how hard I fought.” Kirk went to the par-5 18th with a one-shot lead. His tee shot found the fairway. His second shot found the water, leading to bogey. Cole made par, giving Kirk new life in the playoff. “Bad swing at the wrong time . . . Thank God it worked out,” Kirk said. Kirk hadn’t held a trophy since 2015. That’s not to say he hasn’t done any winning in that span. He walked away from the game in May 2019 because of alcoholism and depression. He struggled with anxiety, struggled to deal with pressure, even though he had a penchant for making it seem like no big deal. — AP
