The Herald NEW DELHI. — India spinner Ravindra Jadeja returned career-best figures of 7-42 to lead Australia’s hammering by six wickets inside three days yesterday to bring the hosts to a 2-0 Test cricket series lead. Jadeja, a left-arm orthodox, teamed up with fellow spinner Ravichandran Ashwin to dismiss Australia for 113 in a morning session when the tourists’ batting imploded, thanks to an overused sweep shot on a tricky New Delhi pitch. The hosts romped to their victory target of 115 in the second session to guarantee them retention of the Border-Gavaskar trophy in the four-match series. They have won their previous three series against Australia and are now close to securing a spot in the World Test Championship final. India lost skipper Rohit Sharma, run out after a fluent 31, and Virat Kohli, who surpassed 25 000 international runs, stumped on 20. But Cheteshwar Pujara stood firm with 31 in his landmark 100th test to steer the team home with a winning four as wicketkeeper-batsman Srikar Bharat, unbeaten on 23, looked on. Nathan Lyon took two wickets to return a match-haul of seven. — AFP
