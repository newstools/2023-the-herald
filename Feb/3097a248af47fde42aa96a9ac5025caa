The Herald A FRENCH volunteer is set to support the Zimbabwe Olympic Committee (ZOC) as part of the International Olympic Committee-backed Ambassadeurs Generation 2024 programme. ZOC has announced that Pierre-Tite Meslin will be working with all sporting organisations in Zimbabwe over the next 12 months. Following his arrival in Zimbabwe, Meslin has met ZOC president Thabani Gonye and other officials involved in the National Olympic Committee. The Frenchman has also been introduced to Ringisai Mapondera, who is Zimbabwe’s Chef de Mission for the Paris 2024 Olympics, and Prince Edward School headmaster Aggrippa Sora. Amassadeurs Generation 2024 was launched by the French National Olympic and Sports Committee and the Paris 2024 Organising Committee in June 2021 to support NOCs. The programme offers NOCs the opportunity to host volunteers qualified to support the implementation of their development and general interest projects in the fields of education and culture, sports practice, and international co-operation. The NOCs will be able to host one or more young volunteers in the build up to Paris 2024. — Insidethegames.com
