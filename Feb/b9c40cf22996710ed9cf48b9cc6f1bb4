The Herald MOSCOW. – Russian President Vladimir Putin has confirmed that Russia is awaiting the visit of his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping. “We are expecting the president of the People’s Republic of China to visit Russia. We agreed on this earlier,” Putin said as he welcomed director of the office of the Central Foreign Affairs Commission of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and member of the CCP Politburo Wang Yi in the Kremlin yesterday. “We understand that [China] has a domestic political agenda, but we assume that as we tackle all the issues related to this agenda – with the National People’s Congress, which is made up of Chinese deputies, who must also resolve serious personnel issues – we will implement our plans for personal meetings as well, which will give an additional impetus to our relations,” the Russian president noted. Sessions of the highest deliberative and legislative bodies of China – the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference and the National People’s Congress–- will kick off in Beijing on March 4 and 5. Deputies will discuss socio-economic achievements and prospects for the country’s further development and approve new projects. – TASS
