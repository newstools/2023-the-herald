The Herald Takudzwa Chitsiga Sports Reporter ZIMBABWEAN professional golfer Kieran Vincent has moved into the top 50 of the International Series order of merit after his impressive performances in the Qatar event. Vincent is now on position 34 with earnings of US$32 908 after taking part in two tournaments. The 27-year-old took part in the International Series Oman and International Series Qatar where he managed to make both cuts. In the first tournament in Oman, Vincent finished on position 52 to pocket US$7 533 while during last weekend’s tournament he finished on 22nd place to pocket US$25 375. The order of merit is led by American Andrew Ogletree who became the first player to win two International Series events. Ogletree recorded a convincing victory at Sunday’s US$2.5 million International Series Qatar at Doha Golf Club. The impressive 24-year-old from Mississippi, United States, closed with a one-over-par 73 to finish on seven under and win by three shots from Thailand’s Gunn Charoenkul, who fired a 68, helped by an eagle on the par-five 18th. Thailand’s Suradit Yongcharoenchai finished one shot back in third following a 72, while his compatriot Phachara Khongwatmai returned a 67 to claim fourth, another stroke behind. Ogletree, who won the International Series Egypt in November and has two wins in just nine starts on the Asian Tour, started the day with a five-shot lead and was never really challenged, when for the fourth day in a row strong wind were unrelenting. Vincent will take part in the New Zealand Open represented by Sky Sport at Milbrook Resort in Queenstown early next month.
