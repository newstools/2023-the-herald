The Herald Yeukai Karengezeka Court Correspondent An alleged insurance scam saw a man from Mutare yesterday in court for allegedly insuring an already damaged motor vehicle and staging a road traffic accident before claiming US$90 000 cash from the Old Mutual Insurance Company. Munyaradzi Ramhewa (31) appeared before Harare provincial magistrate Mr Dennis Mangosi charged with fraud and was remanded on $300 000 bail to March 30. Prosecutor Mr Pardon Dziva alleged that in May last year, Ramhewa approached Henrics Providence Donga and Llyod Makuzwa, who are already on remand, advising them that his VW Touareg with personalised registration number MUBARWE was involved in an accident. He said the vehicle was parked at his house in Mutare and he wanted it repaired. They decided to defraud Old Mutual Insurance Company to pay for the damage and Ramhewa went on to insure the motor vehicle through Reality Njabulo Chuma for US$90 000, although the SUV had already been involved in an accident. The court heard that on 14 August last year, Donga and Makuzwa went to Mutare where they met Ramhewa and staged the accident as if Ramhewa had crashed the car without involving anyone else. They then went to ZRP Mutare Traffic and reported the fake accident and the police attended the scene, with Road Angels Towing Company called to tow away the damaged vehicle. On September 20 last year, Ramhewa made a concocted claim through Chuma, an employee at Bright Insurance Brokers Private Limited, that the motor vehicle was severely damaged on the front, suspension, engine and gearbox. Acting upon the misrepresentation, Old Mutual went on to process the claim for US$90 000. The alleged fraud came to light when Old Mutual discovered that the photos sent by Ramhewa were different from the ones submitted by Road Angels who towed the vehicle from the scene.
