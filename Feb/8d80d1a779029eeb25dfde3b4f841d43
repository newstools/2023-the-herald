The Herald Takudzwa Chitsiga Sports Reporter FORMER Zimbabwe senior national team goalkeeper Ephraim Mazarura will tomorrow take time to give back to the community which he grew up in Mabvuku/ Tafara by hosting the Mopao Mazet football tournament in conjunction with the Scott Foundation. The former Black Rhinos and Dynamos shot-stopper represented the country at Zimbabwe’s first ever appearance at the Africa Cup of Nations in Tunisia in 2004. Mazarura will take time to scout for players from the Mabvuku/Tafara high-density suburbs at Mabvuku No.1 Ground where he is looking forward to take on board at least 15 players for his Mount Pleasant-based Mopao Mazet Football Academy. Mabvuku is well known for producing top players who went on to make it on the big stage like the Mugeyi twin brothers Wilfred and William, Cephas Chimedza and most recently Marshal Munetsi, who is plying his trade in France. “I am looking forward to host a scouting tournament at Mabvuku No. 1 grounds on Sunday. It will be good to have my first ever talent identification tournament in the high-density suburb. I am looking forward to have at least 15, Under-13 players who will join Mopao Mazet Football Academy and at least 10 Under-20 players. “Growing up in Mabvuku, it has always been my wish to one-day give back to the community and through the support from the Scott Foundation, I think we can get far. “The tournament will have some academies from within the two suburbs bringing in their best players and we will take some on board. My Academy is based in Harare and my heart bleeds as there are no players from my area and I thought I am disadvantaging the community where I grew up. “I am glad to the Scott Foundation for partnering me and make my dream come true. I have since engaged some old friends who have football academies from Mabvuku and they are cooperating and I am sure the tournament will be a success,” said Mazarura.
