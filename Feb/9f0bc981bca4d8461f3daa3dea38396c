The Herald Yeukai Karengezeka and Prosper Dembedza The man who allegedly pointed a gun at Lloyd Gwasira, also known as Madzibaba Moses, the leader and founder of Johane Masowe eChishanu Church in Highfield, was yesterday granted $80 000 bail when remanded to April 19. While Tafadzwa Matoro was granted bail, his co-accused Elvis Borerwi, who is facing assault charges, had his bail ruling rolled over to Monday by magistrate Ms Noticia Shenje. The two were being represented by Messrs Kingston Mukanganwi and Kudakwashe Munyoro. Matoro and Borerwi are related, but not related to Gwasira, although they all come from the same rural area and used to attend the same church. It was alleged that the incident took place on Tuesday morning when Gwasira was moving around to conduct house prayers for his church members in Highfield, Southerton, Lochinvar, Kambuzuma and Warren Park 1 in Harare.  He was moving in a convoy of three vehicles with seven of his followers. While they were in Warren Park 1, they first went to Rodrick Madzima’s house and prayed. The house is three houses down from Borerwi’s house, who is Matoro’s cousin. As Gwasira’s entourage was leaving Mr Madzima’s house, they met Matoro who was driving his vehicle and they had an altercation. Matoro phoned Borerwi to join him. Gwasira continued with his journey and visited another church member, Moreblessing Muriva. But as they were leaving that house, Matoro came driving his vehicle and signalled them to stop. Gwasira stopped his vehicle and Matoro started shouting at him and was joined by Borerwi, both accusing Gwasira of being a wizard causing Matoro’s downfall. Borerwi grabbed Gwasira and dragged him out of his vehicle and shoved him threatening to kill him. During the scuffle, Matoro then went to his vehicle and took his CZ Vzor pistol serial number 159230 which he corked and pointed at Gwasira. Gwasira’s followers swiftly reacted and disarmed Matoro.
