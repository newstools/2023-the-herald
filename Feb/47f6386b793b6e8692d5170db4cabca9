The Herald LONDON. — Carlo Ancelotti will reportedly become Brazil’s next manager. The Real Madrid boss (63) has already allegedly informed some of the squad at the Spanish La Liga football giants he is departing, says journalist Bruno Vicari. And he is set to take charge of the South American side at the end of the season. According to ESPN , neither Brazil or Ancelotti will officially announce the news “as the coach still has a contract with the Spanish club until June 2024”. And they state that he has also not actually penned his deal. However, they claim that he will sign a three-year contract in the summer which will take him until the 2026 World Cup in the United States, Mexico and Canada. But personal terms are still being finalised between the two parties. — The Sun.
