The Herald ABUJA. – The African Union Commission announced Tuesday that it will be sending a 90-strong observer mission to Nigeria for this month’s elections. Africa’s most populous country goes to the polls on February 25 but has been plunged into crisis in the runup to the vote with dire shortages of cash and fuel. The African Union Election Observation Mission (AUEOM) is being headed by former Kenyan president Uhuru Kenyatta, who helped broker a deal to end two years of war in northern Ethiopia and is mediating in the conflict in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. The AU said the objectives of the mission were to provide an “accurate and impartial assessment” of the electoral process, offer recommendations for any improvement in future polls, and demonstrate AU support “towards consolidation of democracy, peace, stability, and development in Nigeria”. Nearly 100 million people will vote to choose the successor to President Muhammadu Buhari, who steps down after two terms as Nigeria struggles with widespread insecurity and economic malaise. Meanwhile,  the Nigerian government has directed that universities and inter-university centres close between 22 February and 14 March ahead of the general elections. The decision follows concerns about the safety and security of staff and students during the poll. The directive issued by the National Universities Commission (NUC) was directed by the Minister of Education, Adamu Adamu, local media reported. – africanews.com
