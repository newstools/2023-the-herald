The Herald Sports Reporter FORMER Dynamos striker Albert Eonde has found a new home at Ghanaian giants Hearts of Oak. The 24-year-old Cameroonian forward penned a three-and-a-half-year deal with the 2000 CAF Champions League winners yesterday. Eonde was among the 13 players released by the Glamour Boys last month following the expiry of his two-year contract with the Harare giants. Hearts of Oak said in a statement they were excited to beef up their attacking options as they continue their chase for a record 22 league titles. “We have strengthened our attacking options with the inclusion of Eonde Albert Dieudonne on a three-year deal,” said the club statement. Hearts of Oak are heavily involved in the Ghana Super League title race. They have amassed 24 points from 14 games and are just one point behind log leaders Aduana Stars towards the halfway stage of the 2022-23 campaign. Eonde previously played for Vipers FC, Canon of Yaoundé, FC Platinum and Rayong FC of Thailand before joining Dynamos in February 2020.
