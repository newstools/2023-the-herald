The Herald Mukudzei Chingwere in Montreux, Switzerland Zimbabwe is digitalising its health management systems, formulating quality assurance frameworks and is open to strategic partnerships as it seeks to guarantee patient safety in its hospitals, Vice President and Minister of Health and Child Care Dr Constantino Chiwenga has said.  Vice President Chiwenga said this when he addressed fellow global health leaders attending the 5th edition of the Patient Safety Global Ministerial Summit 2023 earlier today.  To achieve its goal and augment Government financing, Zimbabwe will need strategic partnerships.
