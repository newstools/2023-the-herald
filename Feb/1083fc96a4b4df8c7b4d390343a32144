The Herald Tadious Manyepo Sports Reporter DEFENDER Wilmore Chimbetu has completed his one-year loan move to Dynamos as the Glamour Boys aims to reclaim their lost glory. The highly-regarded wing-back will also be looking at improving himself in a new environment having spent the last four years playing for his parent team Herentals. He will battle for a starting berth with Emmanuel Jalai, the only player still at Dynamos from the 2018 squad.
