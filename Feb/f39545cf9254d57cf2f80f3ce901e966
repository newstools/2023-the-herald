The Herald Nyore Madzianike-Senior Court Reporter BARELY a fortnight after leaving remand prison after the State withdrew murder charges against him following revelations that Jaison Muvevi was behind the killing of Nyarai Round in September last year in Harare, Nyasha Eusan was again back in court for another but more minor criminal offence committed in 2019. Eusan admitted to conning Chakaonei Matipedza of two smart phones worth US$350 after lying to her that he was in a position to repair them. He then vanished. But Ms Matipedza saw him on a kombi on Monday and told the police who picked him up. After the conviction, he was sentenced to 30 months in prison by Harare magistrate Mrs Munashe Chibanda for theft of trust property. But she suspended 10 months on condition of future good behaviour, and suspended the remaining 20 months on condition that Eusan performs 700 hours of community service. He also has to pay Mr Matipedza $280 000 for the phones. In September 2019 Eusan approached Ms Matipedza at her workplace along Chiremba Road in Hatfield in Harare and told her that he could update the system of her Samsung Note 5 and Note 4. Ms Matipedza then asked her son, Zvikomborero Gonorenda, to accompany Eusan to the city centre where he would update the two phonesâ€™ system. On arrival, Eusan told Zvikomborero to wait for him at Joina City whilst he took the phones to Market Square for systems update. He then vanished. He was arrested last year on suspicion that he was responsible for killing Round before the State withdrew the charges towards the end of last month. Ms Matipedza then spotted him in Epworth while aboard a city-centre bound commuter omnibus on January 30 and informed the police leading to his arrest.
