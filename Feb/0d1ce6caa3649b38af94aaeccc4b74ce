The Herald ACCRA. — The body of footballer Christian Atsu, who died after an earthquake hit Türkiye two weeks ago, has been returned to his native Ghana. The flight landed in Accra late on Sunday, and his coffin was carried away by members of Ghana’s armed forces. Atsu was found dead on Saturday under his home in southern Türkiye. He had been playing for the Hatayspor club. The winger played 65 times for Ghana’s national team and helped his side reach the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations final. The 31-year-old also played for English Premier League sides Everton and Newcastle. Speaking at Kotoka airport in the capital Accra, Ghana’s Vice-President Mahamudu Bawumia said: “We hoped against hope, every day that passed, we prayed and prayed. But alas, when he was found, he was no more.” Bawumia added the late footballer was much loved and would be sorely missed. “It is a painful loss, a very painful one.” He promised Atsu would be given a “befitting” burial. Atsu had been missing since the devastating 7.8 magnitude earthquake on February 6 caused the collapse of his apartment in Antakya, in hard-hit Hatay province. — BBC Sport
