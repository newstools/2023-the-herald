The Herald Yeukai Karengezeka-Court Correspondent A proposal to meet birthed through a WhatsApp group ended with the man allegedly raping the young woman on their first date. Patson Zuni (31) of Mutsvairo village in Seke appeared in court recently charged with rape before Chitungwiza regional magistrate Mrs Gloria Takundwa. He pleaded not guilty and was remanded to February 6. In March last year, the 20-year-old woman and Zuni were in the same WhatsApp group.Â  Zuni then sent a message to her inbox and proposed they meet and she agreed. Later on, Zuni invited her to his home, the court was told. They met at Chanakira village and went into the bush so that they could talk while relaxing. But then Zuni became physical and allegedly raped her, injuring her leg in the process. He told her to go home, which she did. The woman only told her sister a month later after realising she was pregnant. She had tried to phone Zuni, but he blocked her cellphone number. Her sister then managed to phone Zuni using her number. The alleged assault was reported to the police, leading to his arrest. Ms Pamela Dzinduwa prosecuted.
