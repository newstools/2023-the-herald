The Herald CALIFORNIA. — Tiger Woods fired a two-over par 73 in the final round at the Genesis Invitational golf tournament on Sunday, calling four completed rounds in his first start in seven months “progress” even if in classic Woods fashion he’d have liked to do better. “It’s progress, but I didn’t win,” said the 15-time major champion, who is still limited by the severe lower right leg injuries he suffered in a February 2021 car accident, which have required multiple surgeries. “It certainly was a little bit more difficult than I probably let on,” Woods added after posting a one-under-par total of 283 for 72 holes. “My team has been fantastic in getting my body recovered day to day and getting me ready to play each and every day. “That’s the hard part that I can’t simulate at home,” Woods said. “Even if I played four days at home, it’s not the same as adrenaline, it’s not the same as the system being ramped up like that, the intensity, just the focus that it takes to play at this level.” Woods, who reiterated this week that with spinal fusion surgery behind him and a right ankle that will always make walking any course a challenge, he can only hope to play all four major championships in a season with “a couple” of other events scattered through a year. — AFP
