The Herald Takudzwa Chitsiga Sports Reporter LOCAL amateur golfers will rekindle their rivalry for the second tournament on the Zimbabwe Golf Association calendar when they tee off in the inaugural Munhumutapa Strokeplay Championship at Police Golf Club this morning. The Munhumutapa Strokeplay Championship is a new tournament that came in to replace the annual Julius Robinson Trophy which was usually the second tournament of the year. The new tournament carries some World Golf Rankings points and will see junior and amateur golfers taking part. The Zimbabwe Golf Association successfully launched the new golf tournament, which is a 54-hole two-day competition, last week. The Munhumutapa Strokeplay Championship will have both boys and girls who will get an opportunity to get some rankings on the WGR. Police Golf Club captain, Paterson Nyabadza, said they are ready to host the tournament and have been preparing the course well. “I am pleased to be hosting the maiden Munhumutapa Strokeplay Championship and it is going to be a positive for the club. “The course is in good condition despite having some water loggings in some parts of the course because of the incessant rains that we received in the past weeks. The Police Golf Club is playing well and is very competitive as we have planted new trees that are growing well,” said Nyabadza. The tournament will be a 54-hole tournament that will incorporate junior and amateur golfers. Local amateurs to look forward to will be Munashe Ndaruza, Michael Wallace, Tariro November and Panashe Mukumba, among several others.
