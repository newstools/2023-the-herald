The Herald Yeukai Karengezeka Court Correspondent A Harare woman has approached the court seeking a protection order against her ex-husband, who allegedly visits her home regularly without notice under the pretext of visiting his children. Ms Greatwin Chaleka brought Stephen Muguti to the Harare Civil Court last Friday where the matter was heard before magistrate Ms Tamara Chibindi. She complained to the court about how Muguti was harassing her whenever he visited. “I divorced this man sometime back, but we have two children together,” said Ms Chaleka. “The problem is that he comes to my home by force to see the children, almost on a daily basis, although I advised him to take them every weekend.” Responding to the allegations, Muguti said he had the right to see his children. “I visit her every time because I will be checking if my children are safe,” he said. Ms Chibindi deferred the ruling.
