The Herald Walter Nyamukondiwa Kariba Bureau Government and stakeholders in the tourism industry have launched the Kariba Regional Tourism Development and Marketing Strategy, which will reposition the destination for growth. The strategy, which took three years to develop, is expected to revitalise the Kariba region which includes Mana Pools, Kariba Town, Chinhoyi Caves and Lake Kariba among others. Environment, Climate, Tourism and Hospitality Industry Minister Nqobizitha Mangaliso Ndlovu officially launched the strategic plan which is expected to set the tone for the rebound of the tourism industry. Minister Ndlovu said Government would continue to support the tourism sector in the region as it was the main economic activity that creates jobs for the communities and sustains livelihoods. <img class="size-medium wp-image-672816 aligncenter" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/02/zta-1-360x201.jpg" alt="" width="360" height="201" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/02/zta-1-360x200.jpg 360w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/02/zta-1.jpg 680w" sizes="(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px" /> While there was an effort to revamp and establish infrastructure in the sector, he said there was need to improve on service delivery. The event also saw the official opening of the Kariba Safari Lodge which had not been operating for 10 years, adding to Karibaâ€™s bed capacity which has emerged as stumbling block to attracting conferences. Mashonaland West Provincial Affairs and Devolution Minister Mary Mliswa-Chikoka, Zimbabwe Tourism Authority Chief Executive Ms Winnie Muchanyuka, Kariba Revival Committee Chairperson Mr Quinten De Lange, among other stakeholders attended.
