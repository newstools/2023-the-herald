The Herald LONDON. — Cristiano Ronaldo hit another career landmark after scoring FOUR goals in a single game for new side Al-Nassr. The 38-year-old netted a first half double against Al-Wehda on Thursday. His first came in the 21st minute, firing low past goalkeeper Abdulquddus Atiah.  Ronaldo was played through on goal for his second and placed his shot through the keeper’s legs. Shortly after the restart, Ronaldo completed his hat-trick – his first for Al-Nassr. CR7 bagged his treble by cooly converting a trademark penalty. A fourth followed less than 10 minutes later, tapping home after his original shot was saved. His four strikes also tipped him over the 500 league goals landmark. But CR7’s milestone goals didn’t leave fans impressed – as they tore into the shaky goalkeeping. One supporter said on Twitter: “See how hard he’s celebrating in a low league as if he’s scored in a World Cup final.” Another tweeted: “Goalkeeper making it look difficult.” A third said: “That keeper gifted him a brace.” Other fans also noticed Ronaldo’s over the top celebration in what they call a “low league” as he broke out his iconic “SIUUU”. Ronaldo’s four strikes added to the one he already had for Al-Nassr, taking his season total to five goals in three games. — The Sun.
