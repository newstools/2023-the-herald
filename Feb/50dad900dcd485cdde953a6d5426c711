The Herald MANCHESTER. — Manchester United will be without star midfielder Christian Eriksen until April — with the Dane sustaining an ankle injury in their FA Cup clash with Reading. Andy Carroll lunged in from behind Eriksen, leaving the United star in pain on the floor. Eriksen was later seen leaving Old Trafford on crutches, while Carroll was eventually sent off on Saturday evening after a late challenge on Casemiro. In a statement, United said: “Christian Eriksen is expected to be out of action for an extended period because of an ankle injury sustained in our FA Cup victory over Reading on Saturday. “Our Danish midfielder was withdrawn in the second half of the 3-1 win after being caught by a tackle from Reading striker Andy Carroll. While investigations are continuing, initial assessments indicate that Eriksen is likely to be out until late April or early May. “Eriksen’s absence will be a big disappointment to manager Erik ten Hag and fans given the consistency of his performances throughout the season so far. “However, there is hope that Christian can return in time to play a role in the final stages of the season.“We all wish Christian the best of luck for a speedy recovery!” — The Daily Star
