The Herald Tadious Manyepo Sports Reporter HERENTALS striker Denzel Chimwemwe has decided to pursue other interests after leaving the Students to relocate to England. The former Harare City man is the only player from the Kumbirai Mutiwekuziva squad last season who has left, at least for now. He bid farewell to his former teammates last week. The burly forward has since joined his wife who was already working in the UK. However, the 27-year-old, who scored once last season has not entirely turned his back on the game. He called Mutiwekuziva as soon as he arrived in England to tell him that after he settles, he will find teams to play for starting from the lower divisions.
