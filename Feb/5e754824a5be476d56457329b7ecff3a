The Herald Sports Reporter SOUTHERN Rocks’ trump card, Cephas Zhuwao, came good again with a second half ton in as many matches to lead his side to a 21 runs victory over Tuskers in the Domestic Twenty20 Competition at Old Hararians Sports Club. Zhuwao’s 67 off 37 balls set their opponents a target they could not match. After Rocks were put in to bat, cousins Innocent and Roy Kaia (12 and four respectively) were both out by the time the score was 60 for two in the seventh over, but in the English professional Nick Gubbins Zhuwao found a partner who could match him almost stroke for stroke. The two hammered 67 runs off the next six overs before Zhuwao was bowled by Luke Jongwe for his 67, with three sixes and seven fours, and in the following over Gubbins was bowled by Hamidullah Qadri for 40 off 27 balls. The score was now 137 for four in the 14th over, and Rocks were well on course for 200. This they achieved thanks to Gary Ballance, who scored an unbeaten 46 off 25 balls, and Tafadzwa Tsiga, 23 not out off 14. The final total of 206 for four was a daunting one, all the Tuskers bowlers were severely punished, and the task was too great for their batters. Despite a fine 56 off 36 balls from Clive Madande, Tuskers fell gradually behind the run rate, and when Shumba was out for 24 off 16 at 146 for five, 61 were needed off the last 23 balls. Jongwe was at the crease and he finished with an unbeaten 35 off 21, but when the last ball had been bowled Tuskers were still 21 runs adrift. In another thrilling match across town at Harare Sports Club, a remarkable spell of bowling by Donald Tiripano for Mega Market Mountaineers turned their match against Rhinos around when the latter appeared to be coasting to their third successive victory in this Domestic Twenty20 Competition. Mountaineers, put in to bat, made an indifferent start when they lost their first three wickets for 35 runs, with Carl Mumba taking two wickets in the fifth over. There followed, however, a magnificent fourth-wicket partnership between the 19-year-old Brian Bennett, again showing great ability and temperament, and the more experienced Tony Munyonga, who attacked the bowling in brilliant style to add 146 for the fourth wicket. The stand was only broken in the final over when Munyonga was caught off Mike Chinouya for a brilliant 79, scored off only 44 balls with five sixes and seven fours. Bennett was left not out with 62, taking 48 balls and hitting two sixes and five fours. The innings closed at 187 for four, with Mumba, the most successful bowler, taking two for 37 in three overs. However, Rhinos set a scorching pace with the bat, despite losing their first three wickets for 53 runs in 5.1 overs. They were in danger of falling behind the clock, though, at 91 for four in the 11th over, but Ryan Burl now came in to join Antum Naqvi and smashed 55 off only 22 balls (four sixes, five fours). When Burl was caught off Victor Nyauchi at 163 for five, only 26 more runs were needed off 4.3 overs. This was the turning point, as Tiripano in the next over took three wickets in four balls, including that of Naqvi, and Rhinos crashed to 166 for eight. Neville Madziva was run out and then in his next over Tiripano removed Brandon Mavuta for one to end the match, as Rhinos were all out for 167 in a sensational finish. Tiripano finished with five wickets for 17 runs in 3.3 overs, while Nyauchi had an expensive two for 43 off four, but his dismissal of Burl was crucial. In the last game of the day, aggressive fifties by Wessly Madhevere and Nick Welch took Eagles to an easy eight-wicket victory over Lions at Harare Sports Club in the afternoon. Lions broke with custom by batting when they won the toss, but they were not rewarded for their boldness. Despite 24 from Blessing Muzite, they had four wickets down for 48 in the seventh over, and were greatly indebted to their captain, Marshal Takodza, for a rescue innings of 47 not out off 43 balls to give them any sort of score to bowl at. The best partnership was one of 46 between Takodza and Campbell Macmillan (14) for the fifth wicket, and the total was a modest 137 for seven wickets. Alex Falao took two wickets, but for once Tapiwa Mufudza did not enjoy much success, his three overs going for 28 runs and one wicket. Takodza had a nightmare start as he opened the bowling in the Eagles innings, beginning with two wides that put seven runs altogether on the board before a legitimate delivery had been bowled. Eagles were perhaps too eager to attack when it was unnecessary, because by the end of the third over they had lost Tinashe Kamunhukamwe for one and Tadiwanashe Marumani for 19 off 11 balls. Welch came in to join Madhevere at 30 for two in the third over, and Welch immediately went on the attack. Madhevere took a little longer to play himself in, but then matched Welch stroke for stroke and, whether by arrangement between the two of them or otherwise, both were able to reach unbeaten fifties before victory was achieved. Madhevere finished with 50 not out off 31 balls (two sixes, five fours), while Welch had 54 off 32 (two sixes, seven fours), the final score being 140 for two wickets. This result saw extremely close competition at the top of the table, with Eagles, Rhinos, Rocks and Mountaineers all having eight points from two victories and one defeat. All the teams will rest today and action is expected to resume tomorrow.
