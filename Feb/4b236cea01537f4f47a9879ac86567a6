NatPharm operations director Mr Cleyland Mutambirwa, who died on Friday, was a selfless and dedicated frontline worker who played a pivotal role in the combating of the deadly Covid-19 pandemic. This was said by the Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Health and Child Care Air Commodore Dr Jasper Chimedza in his condolence message to the Mutambirwa family. Air Commodore Dr Chimedza said the late was a pharmacist par excellence, who joined NatPharm in 2021 at the height of the marauding global Covid-19 pandemic. “He was in charge of planning, procurement, warehousing and distribution of medicines and medical equipment in all public health facilities across the country,” said Air Commodore Dr Chimedza. “Mutambirwa was a selfless and dedicated frontline worker who played a pivotal role in the combating of the deadly Covid-19 disease which ravaged the globe and left a trail of destruction. “He was instrumental in the transformation of NatPharm, particularly the upgrading of health infrastructure including the construction of the new NatPharm warehouse in Harare and another warehouse in Mutare, among other interventions. “The Ministry of Health and Child Care has been robbed of a technocrat, loyal and dedicated pharmacist who helped in ensuring improved access to quality and affordable medicines across the country. “Indeed, he has left an indelible mark in the Ministry, at NatPharm and in the country at large,” said Air Commodore Dr Chimedza. He said Mr Mutambirwa’s contribution towards the improvement of the national health delivery system would forever be cherished. “On behalf of the Ministry of Health and Child Care, the entire nation, my family and my own behalf, I extend my deepest and heartfelt condolences to the NatPharm board and staff and the Mutambirwa family for their loss.”
