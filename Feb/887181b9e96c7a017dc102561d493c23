The Herald Yeukai Karengezeka-Arts Correspondent United Kingdom-based Zimbabwean gospel artiste Nyasha Manase has dropped a new offering titled “Ndinovimba Nemi” (I Trust In You) featuring award-winning gospel musician Jonah Chivasa. The worship song produced by Macdonald “MacDee” Chidavaenzi of Eternity Productions is a spiritual uplifting one, talking about trusting and putting one’s faith in God. In an interview, Manase said it was ideal to offer fans something new and refreshing as the year began. “When the year begins, everyone makes plans, but along the way some lose focus to achieve their goals,” she said. “But, with this song it strengthens every believer to always trust God with every situation they encounter.” Manase said her life was a living testimony of how important it was for one to trust in God. She narrated how the collabo was birthed, saying she was humbled to work with Chivasa, who penned the song for her. “How this collaboration came into being was interesting,” she said. “I used to have sessions called ‘Let’s Hang Out’ where I would hang out with different artistes, and producers and would talk about their musical journey. “Jonah was one of the people whom l was supposed to hang out with, but he was unable to turn up.  However, we later caught up and interacted. “We both highlighted that it was a great idea to minister together someday and a couple of months later he informed me of having composed a song that he wanted us to sing together.” Manase said her musical journey started in 2003 after the death of her father and on that night she dreamt singing on a big stage being backed by angelic beings. She said she started composing songs from that time until deciding to take a step further by getting into the studio. Manase then recorded her debut single called “Terera Unzwe” in 2019 followed by a couple of other tracks and collaborations with musicians Kudakwashe Mutsvene, Pastor Josh Kays  and Tawanda Midzi.
