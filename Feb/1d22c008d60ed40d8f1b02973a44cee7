The Herald Takudzwa Chitsiga-Sports Reporter AFTER winning several accolades as a table tennis player, Mutsawashe Clinton Chiremba has set his sights on developing the sport at grassroots level as a coach. The 29-year-old former Zimbabwean collegiate national team table tennis champion, who has more than 15 medals, has taken his development drive to primary schools around Chitungwiza and Ruwa as he looks forward to form an academy. Starting off as volleyball player, Chiremba has set his targets on developing more international table tennis players like top Zimbabwean player Vikram Singh. “l diversified from being a player and ventured into coaching young table tennis athletes in primary schools. I had to volunteer in various institutions like David Livingstone, Old Windsor Primary School as well as Harare Institute of Technology so as to gain experience. “Table tennis has so much potential in the country and it is my hope that we continue to get support and make sure that we develop young athletes. My main target is to form an academy which will capture raw talent in the high-density suburbs as well as introduce the sport throughout the country.” Currently ranked 10th in the national men’s category and among one of the most successful upcoming coaches in the country, Chiremba has a strong desire to improve through continuous learning. “I have an excellent academic track record which I look forward improve by attending coaching clinics and refresher courses. I accept constructive criticism and believe in inspiring other individuals positively with the aim of achieving successful teams and projects,” added Chiremba. A vice sports director and a mental health practitioner, Chiremba is looking forward to take a development project that would engage in attracting people to play table tennis at grassroots level.
