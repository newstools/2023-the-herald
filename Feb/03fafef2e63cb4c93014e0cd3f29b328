The Herald KAMPALA. –  A Ugandan court has ordered a woman to pay her ex-fiance more than US$2 800 for breaking off their engagement after he paid for her studies, saying she caused “inconvenience and psychological anguish”. According to court documents, retired teacher Richard Tumwiine, 64, paid for Fortunate Kyarikunda’s diploma in law while the couple were engaged. The woman – said to be in her early thirties – subsequently “turned against the plaintiff saying she cannot marry an old man”. “Since the promise to marry was not fulfilled by the defendant to the detriment of the plaintiff then the plaintiff is entitled to reimbursement,” Magistrate Charles Mukobi ruled this week in Kanungu, western Uganda. The judge said Kyarikunda had to refund the 9,439,100 Ugandan shillings (US$2 560) that Tumwiine spent on her studies. The court also ordered the defendant to pay “one million shillings (US$271) in general damages to the plaintiff for inconvenience and psychological anguish,” Mukobi added. Kyarikunda neither submitted a defence nor attended proceedings, the court said. Tumwiine said that the case had “left permanent injuries in my heart”. “I have been scorned by friends and relatives as a man who was rejected and conned by a woman on top of disrupting my life,” he added.  – AFP
