The Herald Yeukai Karengezeka-Court Correspondent A bid by a Harare woman to be granted a protection order against her husband flopped after her application was dismissed for lack of description or details of the alleged abuse she said she was suffering. Nyasha Marvelous was accusing her husband Enerst Musarurwa of abusing her. But Harare Civil Court magistrate Ms Tamara Chibindi threw out her application for failing to point out how she was being abused. Responding to the allegations, Mr Musarurwa said it was him who was supposed to file for a peace and protection order against his wife who was unfaithful. “She lied to me for nine months that she was working in Marondera, yet she was staying with a boyfriend,” he said. “During that period I was looking after the children at home. I only discovered her unfaithful acts when I decided to visit her there and I then asked her to pack up her stuff. “She has not given me gupuro (divorce token) yet and she has since moved in with another man, but she comes to bother me and is very violent.” Mr Musarurwa said he did not want his little daughter to stay with the mother, who had a new man who could abuse her. He said his own mother was taking care of the little girl.
