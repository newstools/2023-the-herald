The Herald Sports Reporter NEWLY appointed Zimbabwe National Karate Federation head coach Winston Nyanhete says his new role is an opportunity to give back to the sport. His immediate task is to lead the selection and preparation of the national team to take part in the African Union Sports Council Region Five Karate Championships scheduled for May in Bulawayo. “I have been actively involved in coaching the national team for over a decade and this appointment is an opportunity for me to give back all my experience in karate competition to the new generation. “We have a lot of exciting events this year starting with the AUSC Region Five Karate Championships, which we as the Zimbabwe National Karate Federation are proudly hosting in Bulawayo, in the last week of May 2023. “We have the rare opportunity to field a full team as the hosts because usually the lack of funding holds us back from sending more athletes to regional, continental and international events. This year we can have all the spots on the team filled,” said Nyanhete. ZNKF caters for semi-contact styles and they have introduced a national league to start this month. Nyanhete said the league will help develop the sport and make it easier to identify talent as well as selection of national teams.
