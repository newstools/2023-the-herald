The Herald LONDON — Marcus Rashford is now being dubbed “the world’s best player” and has been tipped to win the Ballon d’Or. The Manchester United forward’s fine run of recent form continued on Thursday night as he scored in a thrilling 2-2 draw away to Barcelona. Rashford also helped set up United’s second goal with a mazy run as the Red Devils left Spain with their Europa League play-off round tie still in the balance ahead of the return leg at Old Trafford. His performance during the second half in particular has left United fans drooling on social media and even speculating that he could win the Ballon d’Or. One fan reacted to Rashford’s goal by tweeting: “MARCUS RASHFORD IS THE BEST PLAYER IN THE WORLD!!! SPREAD THE WORD!!!!!!” Another responded to the question “could Marcus Rashford win the Ballon d’Or next year?” by writing: “Give it to him now.” A third also answered: “Of course.” Former United defender Rio Ferdinand was also full of praise for Rashford, tweeting: “@MarcusRashford is on smoke. He is on a new level, a level he hasn’t been at until now, a level of consistency he hasn’t been able to stay at until now. A fit, focused, direct, confident, deadly & potent Rashford is not to be messed with!” Rashford’s goal at the Camp Nou is his fourth in five Europa League appearances this season, having starred for United during the group stage prior to the World Cup break. Since returning to club football after the tournament, Rashford has bordered on unplayable with his form in front of goal, scoring 14 goals in 16 appearances, including Thursday night’s European contest. The England international also equalled a record previously only achieved by Wayne Rooney last week with his goal in the home draw against Leeds United. In scoring, Rashford found the back of the net for the sixth consecutive home league match for United, the first time a player has done so since Rooney in April 2012. —The Daily Star
