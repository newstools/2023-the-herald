The Herald Herald Reporter The trial of a former Delatfin Civil Engineering finance manager and two car dealers on allegations of swindling the firm of US$3 350 865,41 after they allegedly sold commonage stands and pocketed the money, failed to start yesterday after their lawyer sought more documents to prepare for the trial, but should resume today. Jacob Muyambo, Amos Kagona, Saymore Mutakura are charged with fraud. It is the Stateâ€™s case that from August 2015 to March 2018 Muyambo, Kagona and Mutakura teamed up with Wasara Kupakwashe, who is on the run, defrauded Delatfin Civil Engineering. The State alleges that Kagona and Mutakura posed as car suppliers to Felix Munyaradzi, the Delatfin chief executive. It is alleged that they started selling commonage stands allocated to the Ministry of Local Government, Public Works and National Housing by Delatfin. After sale of the stands, Wasara would allegedly prepare fake agreements of sale purporting that the stands in question would have been sold with Muyambo, in his capacity as the finance manager approving the sale and indicating that Kagona and Mutakura had paid. It is alleged that they would then share the proceeds, while they were fully aware that these stands were to be disposed of at a later stage and that their employer would not notice at the time that the stands were being disposed of. The three are expected back in court for trial today. Magistrate Mr Stanford Mambanje presided while Mr Tafara Chirambira prosecuted.
