The Herald Tadious Manyepo Sports Reporter THREE Zimbabwe Women’s national team players will have a chance to play international football again after they joined Zambian champions Green Buffaloes on a one-year loan. The trio has been loaned by their parent club Faith Drive Queens. They will have a chance to play international football at a time when the country is barred from partaking in the international game by FIFA as they will play in the CAF Women’s Champions League. Twenty-three year old winger Alice Moyo who was also on loan at Herentals Queens last year as well as teenagers Cathrine Gwangwara and Bethel Kondo impressed the Zambian side in a two-week trial that ended last week. And they have duly been rewarded with a one year stay at the Lusaka-based team.
