The Herald MOSCOW. –  Parallel visits by US President Joe Biden to Ukraine and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken to Turkey are the United States’ attempt to distract attention from Russian President Vladimir Putin’s message to the Federal Assembly, due today. This “propaganda attack” will not produce any tangible results in the zone of Russia’s special operation, though, Andrey Bystritsky, the board chairman of the Foundation for the Development and Support of the Valdai discussion club,  said yesterday. Bystritsky said the visits were synchronized “propaganda attacks” ahead of the Russian leader’s message to both houses of parliament. “We are witnessing a propaganda salvo from the West against Russia,” he stressed. “It is an attempt to intercept the agenda.” According to the analyst, in this way the US leadership is trying to influence the domestic audience in anticipation of the upcoming US presidential election next year. “The election is drawing near. In the meantime, Biden has no special results to this credit. Success in Ukraine would give the Democrats a huge competitive edge in the next presidential election,” he continued. “ Blinken’s task is to overcome Turkey’s resistance to Sweden and Finland joining NATO.” Earlier, Biden, who arrived in Kiev on an unannounced visit yesterday, promised a further US$500 million worth of weaponry, including artillery ammunition, anti-armour systems and air defence radars. – TASS
