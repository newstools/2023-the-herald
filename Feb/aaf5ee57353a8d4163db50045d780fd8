The Herald Chido Nyamuyaruka Court Correspondent A man was murdered on National Youth Day last week in a bar in Hatcliffe, Harare, with Obey Francis Tiago (45) appearing before Harare provincial magistrate Mr Dennis Mangosi facing murder charges. It is alleged that he killed Munyaradzi Kambudzi. Tiago was remanded in custody to March 13 and he was advised to approach the High Court for bail since he is facing a third schedule offence. The court heard that on February 21, and at Hotties Bar in Hatcliffe, Harare, Tiago caused the death of Kambudzi. Investigations are still underway to ascertain the circumstances that led to the murder.
