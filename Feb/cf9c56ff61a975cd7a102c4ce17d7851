ZIMBABWE’S representatives at the World Cross Country Championships in Bathurst, Australia, Blessing Waison and Olivia Chitate, found the going tough on Saturday as they missed out on the top 10. Waison and Chitate competed in the senior men’s and women’s 10km races respectively. Waison finished on position 49 in 32minutes 23seconds, out of the 109 athletes that completed the men’s 10km race. Uganda’s Jacob Kiplimo was the first to cross the finish line in 29minutes 17seconds. He was followed home by Berihu Aregawi with a time of 29minutes 26seconds and Joshua Cheptegei was third in 29minutes 37seconds. Chitate finished on position 65 out of 84 participants in the women’s section with a time of 40minutes 6seconds. She admitted it was a tough race. “I don’t want to lie, it was tough. That was the best I have done. “Looking at the time, comparing cross country and track, they are two different events, the course was not easy even if we look at the time of the winner. But I think we need to keep on working hard. “I think I will sit down with my coach and discuss what’s next considering the results from yesterday’s (Saturday) race,” said Chitate. The senior women’s 10km was won by Kenya’s Beatrice Chebet in 33minutes 48seconds. On second place was Tsigie Gebreselama from Ethiopia in 33minutes 56seconds and another Kenyan, Agnes Jebet Ngetich, came third in 34minutes. The top 10 in both the senior men and women was dominated by African countries, mostly Kenya, Ethiopia and Uganda. According to World Athletics, the top eight from the World Cross Country ranking, not directly qualified through entry standard or world 10 000m ranking, will be considered as having qualified for the upcoming World Athletics Championships to be staged in Budapest, Hungary, and Paris 2024 Olympic Games. The global meet is going to be staged in Budapest from August 19 to 27. The National Athletics Association of Zimbabwe had hoped the two athletes make the top 10 or top 20 at the event. The national association’s president, Tendayi Tagara, said they are going back to the drawing board. “For our female athlete, it was tough. For the male athlete, the time was encouraging as he ran 32minutes compared to 29minutes by the winner. “So it’s back to the drawing board as Waison attempt another race at the South Africa Championship Marathon in March,” said Tagara. In South Africa, they will be chasing the qualifying time of 27minutes 10seconds for men and 30minutes 40seconds for women for the 10 000m event. World Athletics last year included 5km and 10km road events in their qualification system for 5000m and 10 000m respectively.
