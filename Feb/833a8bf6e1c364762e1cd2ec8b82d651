The Herald MANCHESTER. — Erik Ten Hag has confirmed Marcus Rashford is a doubt for tomorrow’s Carabao Cup final against Newcastle. The red-hot England star, 25, sparked injury concerns with a cryptic Instagram post following the 2-1 Europa League win over Barcelona on Thursday night.  And Ten Hag appears to have confirmed Rashford could miss Man Utd’s first Wembley showdown in six years. When asked about Rashford’s knock, Ten Hag said: “I don’t know, the players now are coming in. “We have to do investigations, medical of course. “We did straight after the game, but most of the time you have to wait for a 100 per cent diagnosis. “So let’s do the medical, the work, we have to wait.”  Rashford was in action as Man Utd side edged past Barcelona in the Europa League. Ten Hag’s men produced a rousing comeback to win 2-1 on the night and 3-2 on aggregate.  But Rashford’s evening ended on a sour note as he was subbed off in the 88th minute, looking clearly uncomfortable.  The red-hot forward removed his left boot and walked straight down the tunnel after talking to Ten Hag.  After the match, he took to Instagram – but not just to celebrate the win like many of his team-mates. Instead, he posted a snap of himself walking off with his boot in his hand, accompanied by a bandaged emoji. Fans quickly took that to mean he was an injury worry for tomorrow. And Ten Hag’s update appears to have confirmed that.  Rashford’s absence would be a huge loss with the England ace in scintillating form since the World Cup. The forward has bagged 17 goals in 20 appearances after returning from Qatar.
