The Herald Sports Reporter ZIMBABWE international Marshall Munetsi scored and provided an assist as Stade de Reims thrashed rivals Troys 4-0 in a French Ligue 1 club encounter between rivals from the Champagne region. Munetsi opened the scoring for Reims, unmarked at the back post, with just 10 minutes played yesterday before setting up Myziane Maolida for the second just before half time. The leagueâ€™s top scorer Folarin Balogun made it 3-0 with his 15th of the campaign, five minutes into the second half. Munetsi pulled out injured in the 64th minute and the man that replaced him Jens Cajuste added a late fourth for Reims. The side remains unbeaten in 15 games under their 30-year-old manager, Will Still. Munetsi now has four goals and two assists to his name this season.
