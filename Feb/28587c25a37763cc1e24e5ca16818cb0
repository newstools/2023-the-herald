The Herald Yeukai Karengezeka-Court Correspondent A WOMAN from Chitungwiza has been handed a three-month suspended sentence for aborting twins and burying the remains in the backyard of her home. Tanyaradzwa Dondo (24) appeared before Chitungwiza magistrate Miss Chiedza Manase charged with concealing the birth of a child. She pleaded guilty, was convicted and handed a suspended three months sentence on condition that she does not commit a similar crime within the next five years. On January 24 at around 9am, Dondo told Tendai Chirohuona who lives in the same house with her that she was bleeding. Chirohuona noticed that Dondo’s belly was now smaller than what it used to be and asked if she had a miscarriage but she denied this. The truth came to light when Chirohuona’s maid, Linet Mazonde, told him that she had seen Dondo digging a hole behind the house on the pretext that she wanted to dispose of her used pads. Chirohuona and other tenants dug up the hole and found a black plastic bag with two dead babies. They informed the police leading to her arrest. A post-mortem was also conducted and Dondo was medically examined.
